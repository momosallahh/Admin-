                            <h3>🔍 Thorough Inspections Essential</h3>
                            <p>At Warren's low prices, home condition varies dramatically. Elite Roofing's inspection identifies roof issues that could cost $5,000-$10,000 to fix. On a $130k house, this knowledge is critical for negotiating and budgeting.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🏫 School District Research</h3>
                            <p>Warren Woods district commands premium prices but delivers better schools. Warren Consolidated is adequate but not exceptional. Decide if school quality justifies $30-50k price premium for your family's needs.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>💰 Maximum Metro Detroit Value</h3>
                            <p>Warren offers Metro Detroit's best affordability. Where else can you buy a solid brick ranch for $120k? Perfect for first-time buyers, automotive workers, or anyone maximizing purchasing power.</p>

                            <h3>🚗 Automotive Industry Dependence</h3>
                            <p>Warren's economy depends heavily on automotive. GM Tech Center, Chrysler facilities, suppliers dominate employment. This provides job opportunities but also makes housing market vulnerable to industry downturns.</p>

                            <p>Many Warren homes need updates but have solid bones. Buy for $110k, invest $30k in kitchen/bath/roof (Elite Roofing handles roofing affordably), own $160k+ home. Sweat equity builds substantial value.</p>

                            <h3>📍 Location Within Warren Matters</h3>
                            <p>Warren is huge - 34 square miles. Northern areas (Warren Woods) are nicer than southern areas. Research specific neighborhoods carefully - Warren varies significantly by location.</p>
