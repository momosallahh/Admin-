                    <h2>Common Roofing Problems in Lansing</h2>

                    <p>Based on our experience serving Lansing homeowners for over 15 years, these are the most frequent roofing issues we encounter:</p>

                    <h3>1. Ice Dam Formation (Major Winter Concern)</h3>
                    <p>Lansing's cold winters combined with fluctuating temperatures create ideal conditions for ice dams, which can cause significant water damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Proper attic insulation (R-49 minimum for Michigan), balanced ventilation system, and ice & water shield protection on all eaves. Heat cables for problem areas.</p>

                    <h3>2. Hail Damage from Severe Thunderstorms</h3>
                    <p>Central Michigan experiences frequent severe thunderstorms with hail, particularly May through August.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Class 4 impact-resistant shingles provide excellent protection and qualify for insurance discounts (typically 10-25% in Lansing area).</p>

                    <h3>3. Wind Damage from Frontal Systems</h3>
                    <p>Lansing's position in the center of the state means it gets hit by strong wind systems from multiple directions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> High-wind rated shingles with proper installation (6-nail pattern), sealed shingles, and reinforced ridge caps. Essential for exposed locations.</p>

                    <h3>4. Aging Infrastructure in Historic Areas</h3>
                    <p>Old Town and other historic Lansing neighborhoods have homes with older roofing systems that need careful evaluation and updating.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Comprehensive roof inspections before purchase, proper ventilation retrofits, and modern materials that respect architectural character.</p>

                            <p>Schedule professional inspections every spring after winter damage season. Fall inspection prepares roof for coming winter. Catch problems early before they become expensive repairs.</p>
