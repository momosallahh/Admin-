                <section class="content-section" id="common-issues">
                    <h2>Common Roofing Problems in Flint</h2>

                    <p>Based on our experience serving Flint homeowners, these are the most frequent roofing issues we encounter:</p>

                    <h3>1. Deferred Maintenance Issues</h3>
                    <p>Many Flint homes have roofs that haven't received regular maintenance, leading to accelerated wear and preventable damage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Regular inspections (at least annually) catch small problems before they become expensive repairs. Many issues can be fixed affordably if caught early. We offer honest assessments focused on necessary repairs, not sales pressure.</p>

                    <h3>2. Ice Dam Formation</h3>
                    <p>Poor attic insulation and ventilation in older homes creates ice dams that damage shingles and cause leaks.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Cost-effective ventilation improvements and basic attic insulation upgrades prevent most ice dams. Ice & water shield on eaves provides backup protection. Heat cables for chronic problem areas.</p>

                    <h3>3. Wind Damage from Severe Weather</h3>
                    <p>Older or improperly installed shingles are vulnerable to Flint's frequent wind events, especially severe thunderstorms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Proper installation with adequate fasteners is more important than premium materials. Quality architectural shingles properly installed outperform expensive materials poorly installed.</p>

                    <h3>4. Storm Chaser Scams After Severe Weather</h3>
                    <p>Flint neighborhoods often attract unscrupulous contractors after storms, leading to poor work and homeowner losses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Work only with established local contractors. Never pay in full upfront. Verify insurance and licensing. Get multiple quotes. If it seems too good to be true, it is.</p>

                        <div class="warning-icon">⚠️</div>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All roof replacements in Flint require a building permit through the City's Inspection Services Department. Working without permits can result in fines and insurance complications.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Permit Requirements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Typically $50-100 depending on project scope (affordable)</li>
                        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-7 business days for approval</li>
                        <li><strong>Inspection Required:</strong> Yes, final inspection ensures work meets code</li>
                        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Through City of Flint Inspection Services</li>
                        <li><strong>Contractor Responsibility:</strong> Reputable contractors handle permit process</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Permits protect YOU. They ensure contractors follow building codes and provide recourse if work is substandard. Never let a contractor talk you out of getting proper permits. Elite Roofing handles all permit applications as part of our service.</p>

                    <h3>Why Permits Matter:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✓ Ensures work meets safety and building codes</li>
                        <li>✓ Required for insurance claims if future damage occurs</li>
                        <li>✓ Protects property value when selling</li>
                        <li>✓ Provides documentation of proper installation</li>
                        <li>✓ Final inspection catches problems before contractor leaves</li>

                    <p>Protecting your Flint home from weather damage doesn't require expensive solutions - smart, cost-effective strategies work best:</p>

                            <h3>🔍 DIY Visual Inspections</h3>
                            <p>Check your roof from ground level several times yearly. Look for missing/damaged shingles, sagging areas, or debris accumulation. Call professionals for any concerns - early detection saves money.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>🍃 Keep Gutters Clear</h3>
                            <p>Clean gutters yourself twice yearly (spring and fall) or hire help affordably. Clogged gutters cause ice dams and water damage. Ladder safety is critical - hire if uncomfortable with heights.</p>

                            <h3>❄️ Basic Ice Dam Prevention</h3>
                            <p>Ensure adequate attic insulation (check local programs for assistance). Keep attic vents clear of insulation. Seal air leaks around attic access. These simple steps prevent most ice dams.</p>
