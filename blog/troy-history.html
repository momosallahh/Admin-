                    <p class="lead-paragraph">Troy's transformation from sparsely populated farmland to Michigan's most affluent city represents the quintessential American suburban success story. In just seven decades, Troy evolved from rural township to thriving city of over 87,000, home to major corporate headquarters, excellent schools, and diverse, prosperous communities.</p>

                    <p>As Troy's local roofing experts since 2009, Elite Roofing is proud to serve this dynamic community. We've worked throughout Troy's neighborhoods, from established subdivisions to newer developments, protecting homes in Oakland County's premier city.</p>

                    <p>Let's explore the remarkable transformation of Troy from farmland to suburban powerhouse.</p>

                    <h2>Early Settlement & Farming Era (1820s-1950)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1822 - Troy Township Established</h3>
                        <p>Troy Township was organized as one of Oakland County's first townships, named after Troy, New York, following the common practice of naming Michigan settlements after Eastern cities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The first European-American settlers arrived in the 1820s, finding rolling terrain, scattered oak groves, and fertile soil. The land was previously inhabited by various Native American peoples, including the Potawatomi and Ojibwe, who were displaced by treaties opening Southeast Michigan to American settlement.</p>

                    <p>Early Troy was entirely agricultural. Farmers grew wheat, corn, and hay, raised livestock, and sold produce to Detroit's growing markets. Small settlements emerged around crossroads and mills, but Troy remained rural and sparsely populated throughout the 19th century.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1827 - First School Established</h3>
                        <p>Troy's commitment to education began early with the establishment of its first school. This emphasis on education would later become a defining characteristic of the suburban city.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>By 1900, Troy Township had only about 1,400 residents scattered across family farms. Life changed little through the early 20th century. While Detroit boomed with automotive manufacturing, Troy remained peaceful farmland—a "day's buggy ride" from the city.</p>

                    <p>Even by 1950, Troy's population was only 6,300, primarily farmers and rural residents. The township seemed destined to remain agricultural indefinitely. But forces were gathering that would transform Troy beyond recognition in just one generation.</p>

                <!-- Suburban Explosion -->
                <section class="content-section" id="suburban-boom">
                    <h2>Suburban Explosion (1950-1980)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1955 - City of Troy Incorporated</h3>
                        <p>Troy incorporated as a city to control its own development as suburban growth accelerated. This decision proved crucial in shaping Troy's high-quality development standards.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Post-World War II prosperity, the baby boom, and automotive industry success drove massive suburban expansion. Detroit-area families sought new homes with yards, good schools, and modern amenities. Troy's location—north of Detroit with excellent highway access—made it perfect for suburban development.</p>

                    <p>Farmland was sold and subdivided at unprecedented rates. Where corn grew one year, ranch homes appeared the next. Developers built entire neighborhoods in months. Young families moved in, establishing communities virtually overnight.</p>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Population Explosion</h3>
                            <p>Troy's growth was staggering: 6,300 residents in 1950 to 19,200 in 1960 to 39,400 in 1970 to 67,100 by 1980. The city more than doubled every decade!</p>

                            <p>Troy built schools, parks, libraries, and municipal facilities at breakneck pace. The city's planning department worked to maintain quality despite rapid growth.</p>

                        <h3>1969 - Oakland Mall Opens</h3>
                        <p>The opening of Oakland Mall symbolized Troy's transformation from farmland to suburban commercial center. The mall became a regional shopping destination and economic anchor.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Troy's school district became a major draw for families. New schools opened regularly, and the district developed a reputation for academic excellence that attracted residents willing to pay premium prices for Troy homes.</p>

                    <p>By 1980, Troy had transformed completely. Virtually all farmland had been developed. The city offered excellent housing, top schools, shopping, and services—everything suburban families desired. Troy had become Oakland County's premiere residential address.</p>

                <!-- Corporate Headquarters Era -->
                <section class="content-section" id="corporate-growth">
                    <h2>Corporate Headquarters Era (1980-2000)</h2>

                    <p>As Troy matured residentially, it began attracting corporate headquarters and office development, transforming from bedroom community to major employment center.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1980s - Big Beaver Road Corporate Corridor</h3>
                        <p>Big Beaver Road (M-59) developed into a major corporate corridor. Office buildings and corporate campuses rose along the highway, bringing thousands of white-collar jobs to Troy.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Major corporations established headquarters in Troy, attracted by educated workforce, excellent location, quality of life, and business-friendly environment. Kmart, Merrill Lynch, Kelly Services, and other major companies built significant operations in Troy.</p>

                    <p>The Somerset Collection, an upscale shopping mall, opened in 1996, establishing Troy as a luxury retail destination. The mall's success reflected Troy's affluence and attracted more high-end retailers and restaurants.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Economic Diversification</h3>
                            <p>Troy successfully balanced residential quality with commercial development. Unlike pure bedroom suburbs, Troy offered substantial employment, reducing commute times and strengthening the local economy.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>International Businesses</h3>
                            <p>Troy attracted international corporations, particularly Japanese automotive suppliers supporting Detroit's auto industry. This international presence added cultural diversity and global connections.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>By 2000, Troy had achieved remarkable success: population of 80,959, median household income well above state averages, excellent schools ranked among Michigan's best, low crime, and a thriving business community. Troy represented suburban success—the American Dream realized.</p>

                <section class="content-section" id="modern-troy">
                    <h2>Modern Troy (2000-Today)</h2>

                    <p>The 21st century brought new challenges and continued evolution as Troy matured from growing suburb to established city.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>2008-2009 - Economic Recession Impact</h3>
                        <p>The automotive industry crisis and recession affected Troy as corporate relocations slowed and some headquarters downsized. However, Troy's economic diversity cushioned the impact compared to manufacturing-dependent cities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Troy adapted by focusing on emerging sectors: technology, healthcare, professional services, and international business. The city attracted tech companies and startups, leveraging its educated workforce and quality of life to compete for knowledge economy jobs.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Growing Diversity</h3>
                            <p>Troy became increasingly diverse, with significant Asian (particularly Indian and Chinese), Middle Eastern (particularly Chaldean), and other immigrant populations. This diversity enriched the community and created international business connections.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Urban Amenities</h3>
                            <p>Troy developed urban amenities rare in suburbs: diverse dining (reflecting international populations), cultural events, libraries, and recreation facilities that created city-like vibrancy.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Education remained Troy's calling card. Troy School District continued ranking among Michigan's top districts, and Troy High School consistently achieved recognition as one of America's best public high schools. Families continued choosing Troy primarily for schools.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>2020s - Continued Evolution</h3>
                        <p>Troy entered the 2020s with population around 87,000, stable and prosperous. The city focused on maintaining infrastructure, adapting to remote work trends, and preserving quality of life that made Troy special.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Today's Troy balances multiple identities: premier residential suburb, major employment center, culturally diverse community, and shopping destination. The transformation from farmland to modern city took just seven decades—a remarkably rapid evolution that created one of Michigan's most successful communities.</p>

                    <h2>Troy's Residential Architecture</h2>

                    <p>Troy's housing stock reflects suburban development eras from the 1950s through today. Ranch homes from the 1950s-60s, split-levels and colonials from the 1970s, and larger homes from the 1980s-90s create diverse neighborhoods.</p>

                    <p>Unlike older Michigan cities with historic Victorian homes, Troy's character comes from quality post-war construction. These homes feature solid construction, good materials, and thoughtful design that has aged well. Established neighborhoods with mature trees and landscaping create attractive, livable communities.</p>
