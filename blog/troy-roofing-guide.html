                    <p>Troy's upscale homes often feature complex roof lines with multiple valleys, dormers, and architectural details that create ice dam vulnerability.</p>

                    <h3>3. Hail Damage to Luxury Roofs</h3>
                    <p>Oakland County experiences periodic severe hailstorms that can damage even premium roofing materials, affecting both function and aesthetics.</p>

                    <h3>4. Matching Aesthetic Standards</h3>
                    <p>Troy homeowners expect roofing that enhances property value and neighborhood aesthetics, not just functional protection.</p>
