                <section class="content-section" id="common-issues">
                    <h2>Common Roofing Problems in Warren</h2>

                    <p>Based on our extensive experience serving Warren homeowners, these are the most frequent roofing issues we encounter:</p>

                    <h3>1. Aging Roofs in Established Neighborhoods</h3>
                    <p>Many Warren homes were built in the 1950s-1970s during the automotive industry's peak. These homes often have roofs approaching or exceeding their design life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional inspection determines remaining roof life and repair vs. replacement decision. Modern materials offer superior performance and longer warranties than original roofing. Proactive replacement prevents emergency situations and interior damage.</p>

                    <h3>2. Ice Dam Problems on Ranch Homes</h3>
                    <p>Warren's many ranch-style homes with low roof pitches and long eaves are particularly vulnerable to ice dam formation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Proper attic insulation (R-49 minimum), adequate ventilation, ice & water shield on all eaves and valleys. Heat cables for chronic problem areas. Address during roof replacement for best results.</p>

                    <h3>3. Storm Damage from Severe Weather</h3>
                    <p>Warren experiences frequent severe thunderstorms with damaging straight-line winds and occasional hail throughout summer months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> High-wind rated shingles properly installed with adequate fasteners (6-nail pattern). Impact-resistant options protect against hail. Regular post-storm inspections catch damage early before it worsens.</p>

                    <h3>4. Inadequate Ventilation in Older Homes</h3>
                    <p>Many Warren homes lack modern roof ventilation systems, leading to premature shingle failure, ice dams, and moisture problems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ridge vent and soffit vent installation during roof replacement. Dramatically extends shingle life (often 5-10 years), improves energy efficiency, prevents moisture damage in attic.</p>

                    <div class="warning-box glass-card">
                        <div class="warning-icon">⚠️</div>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All roof replacements in Warren require a building permit through the City's Building Department. Warren has clear processes and professional inspection standards.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Permit Requirements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Typically $100-175 depending on project scope</li>
                        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 3-7 business days for approval (efficient process)</li>
                        <li><strong>Inspection Required:</strong> Yes, final inspection after project completion is mandatory</li>
                        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Through City of Warren Building Department</li>
                        <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Contractor license verification, project description, estimated cost</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Warren's Building Department is professional and reasonable. Work with experienced contractors like Elite Roofing who handle all permit applications and consistently pass inspections on first review. We know Warren's requirements well.</p>

                    <h3>City Code Highlights:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✓ Proper ventilation required (inspectors verify 1:150 ratio minimum)</li>
                        <li>✓ Ice & water shield required on eaves and valleys per Michigan code</li>
                        <li>✓ Maximum 2 layers of shingles permitted (complete tear-off if already 2 layers)</li>
                        <li>✓ Daily cleanup required in residential neighborhoods (city enforces this)</li>
                        <li>✓ Permits protect homeowners - ensure code compliance and proper documentation for insurance</li>

                    <h2>Storm Damage Prevention Tips</h2>

                    <p>Warren's location in Macomb County brings frequent severe weather year-round. Protect your roof with these proven strategies:</p>

                            <h3>🔍 Annual Professional Inspections</h3>
                            <p>Schedule inspection every spring to assess winter damage and prepare for summer storm season. Fall inspection before winter equally important. Early detection prevents expensive repairs. Many contractors offer free initial inspections to Warren homeowners.</p>

                            <h3>❄️ Ice Dam Prevention Strategy</h3>
                            <p>Ensure adequate attic insulation (R-49 minimum for Michigan). Keep attic vents clear and functional. Install ice & water shield on all eaves during replacement. Heat cables available for chronic problem areas. Prevention far cheaper than damage repair.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>🍃 Regular Gutter Maintenance</h3>
                            <p>Clean gutters minimum twice yearly (spring and fall). Many Warren homes have mature trees requiring more frequent cleaning. Quality gutter guards reduce maintenance burden significantly. Proper drainage protects foundation, basement, and landscaping investments.</p>

                            <p>High-wind rated shingles essential for severe thunderstorm season. Proper installation with 6 nails per shingle prevents blow-offs. Sealed shingles resist wind uplift. Regular inspection catches loose shingles before complete failure.</p>
