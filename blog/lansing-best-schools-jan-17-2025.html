                        <h3>💡 Tips for Choosing a School in Lansing</h3>
                        <div class="tips-list glass-card">
                            <h4>✓ Start Research Early</h4>
                            <p>
                                Many top schools (especially private and charter) have application deadlines 6-12 months before
                                enrollment. Okemos and East Lansing homes sell quickly for their schools, so plan housing early.
                            </p>

                            <h4>✓ Visit Schools in Person</h4>
                            <p>
                                Schedule tours, meet principals, observe classrooms, and talk to current parents. Each school has
                                a unique culture—find the right fit for your child's learning style and needs.
                            </p>

                            <h4>✓ Check Multiple Rating Sources</h4>
                            <p>
                                Use GreatSchools.org, Niche.com, U.S. News rankings, and Michigan Department of Education reports.
                                Don't rely on a single source—look at test scores, graduation rates, and college readiness.
                            </p>

                            <h4>✓ Consider Your Commute</h4>
                            <p>
                                Factor in distance to work, traffic patterns, and school bus availability. East Lansing and Okemos
                                offer walkability; suburban districts may require driving.
                            </p>

                            <h4>✓ Evaluate Extracurriculars</h4>
                            <p>
                                Sports, arts, clubs, and activities matter for well-rounded development. Okemos and East Lansing
                                excel in both academics and extracurriculars.
                            </p>

                            <h4>✓ Understand School Choice Options</h4>
                            <p>
                                Michigan has Schools of Choice allowing enrollment outside your district (with limitations).
                                Research options if you live near district boundaries.
                            </p>

                            <h4>✓ Talk to MSU Families</h4>
                            <p>
                                Many MSU faculty, staff, and grad students choose Okemos or East Lansing for schools. They're
                                educated consumers who've researched thoroughly—learn from their choices.

                            <h4>Q: How do Lansing schools compare to Detroit or Grand Rapids?</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>A:</strong> Lansing area schools generally rank between Detroit (lower) and Grand Rapids
                                (similar). Okemos and East Lansing compete with top Grand Rapids suburbs. Lansing benefits from
                                MSU influence, state government resources, and educated workforce.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Q: Is it worth paying more for a home in Okemos or East Lansing for the schools?</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>A:</strong> Many families say yes—median home prices are $20-40K higher, but schools
                                consistently deliver top results. However, Holt, DeWitt, and Haslett offer 80% of the quality
                                at lower cost. Consider your child's needs and college goals.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Q: Can I enroll in a district where I don't live?</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>A:</strong> Michigan's Schools of Choice program allows some cross-district enrollment,
                                but popular districts like Okemos and East Lansing rarely accept outside students. Check with
                                individual districts for availability.
