                            <p>Southwest Michigan weather is tough on roofs - lake-effect snow, ice, summer storms. Elite Roofing's pre-purchase inspection identifies issues general inspectors miss, potentially saving $7,000-$15,000 in unexpected roof replacement costs.</p>

                            <p>Milwood commands premium for schools. However, Kalamazoo's school-of-choice system means you can live elsewhere and still access quality programs. Research options before paying location premium.</p>

                            <p>Areas near WMU have rental demand but also student-related wear. If buying near campus, budget for deferred maintenance. Elite Roofing often finds rental properties need immediate roof work - factor this into offers.</p>

                            <p>Kalamazoo's medical centers (Bronson, Borgess) provide employment stability. Healthcare workers often prefer Oakwood and Milwood for proximity. Consider your commute when choosing neighborhoods.</p>
