                            during a thunderstorm, water stains on your ceiling after heavy snow melt, or damaged shingles after severe weather,
                            prompt professional repair prevents minor issues from becoming major problems. With Sterling Heights receiving 38
                            inches of annual snowfall and experiencing harsh freeze-thaw cycles, even small roof damage can quickly escalate
                            into thousands of dollars in interior damage.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Common Roof Problems in Sterling Heights Homes</h3>

                        <div class="problems-grid">
                            <div class="problem-item glass-card">
                                <h4>❄️ Ice Dam Damage</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Sterling Heights' 38" of annual snow creates perfect conditions for ice dams. When warm attic air melts
                                    snow on your roof, water runs down and refreezes at the eaves, backing up under shingles and causing leaks.
                                    Common in older homes in Sterling Heights Meadows and along Van Dyke corridor.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Repair Cost:</strong> $500 - $2,000 depending on damage extent</p>

                                <p>
                                    Sterling Heights experiences severe thunderstorms, high winds, and occasional hail. Missing shingles, lifted
                                    edges, and puncture damage are common after major storms. June through August sees the most storm-related
                                    roof damage in our area.

                                <p>
                                    Flashing around chimneys, vents, and roof penetrations deteriorates from freeze-thaw cycles. Water entering
                                    through failed flashing causes leaks that appear far from the actual problem area. Critical inspection point
                                    for homes 15+ years old.

                                <p>
                                    Sterling Heights' temperature extremes (winter lows to -10°F, summer highs to 90°F) stress shingles. Curling,
                                    cracking, and granule loss are signs your roof is aging. Most architectural shingles last 25-30 years in our
                                    climate before needing replacement.

                                <p>
                                    Areas near Dodge Park and the Clinton River Trail have mature trees. Falling branches, especially during
                                    winter storms, can puncture shingles or damage decking. Regular tree trimming prevents most issues.

                                    Inadequate attic ventilation causes premature shingle failure, ice dams, and excessive energy costs. Many
                                    Sterling Heights homes built 1960s-1980s lack proper ventilation. Upgrading ventilation during repairs
                                    prevents future problems.
                                </p>

                                    Many Sterling Heights homes built 1970s-1990s are reaching the point where replacement makes more financial
                                    sense than ongoing repairs.

                                <p>
                                    Have your roof professionally inspected once per year, ideally in fall before winter weather arrives. We offer
                                    free courtesy inspections for past customers and can identify small problems before they become expensive leaks.

                                    Clean gutters at least twice yearly (spring and fall). Clogged gutters cause water to back up under shingles,
                                    leading to rot and leaks. Especially important near Dodge Park and Clinton River Trail where falling leaves
                                    accumulate quickly.

                                    Keep tree branches at least 10 feet from your roof. Overhanging branches drop debris, provide pathways for
                                    animals, and can cause severe damage during storms. Essential for wooded Sterling Heights neighborhoods.

                                    Proper ventilation prevents ice dams, extends shingle life, and reduces energy costs. If your Sterling Heights
                                    home experiences ice dams, upgrading ventilation during repair work is highly recommended.

                                <h4>Q: How quickly can you repair my leaking roof in Sterling Heights?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A: For emergencies, we typically respond same-day, often within 2-4 hours. We'll perform temporary repairs
                                    immediately to stop water intrusion, then schedule permanent repairs at your convenience. Non-emergency
                                    repairs are usually scheduled within 1-3 business days.

                                <p>
                                    A: It depends on the cause. Storm damage (wind, hail), falling trees, and sudden damage are typically covered.
                                    Normal wear and tear or age-related deterioration usually isn't. We'll inspect your damage, provide documentation,
                                    and help you file a claim if applicable.

                                <p>
                                    A: Yes! We stock all major brands and maintain relationships with suppliers across Metro Detroit. We can match
                                    most shingle styles and colors, even discontinued products. If exact matching isn't possible, we'll discuss
                                    options to blend the repair area.

                                <p>
                                    A: Properly executed repairs should last as long as the surrounding roof material. If your roof is 10 years old
                                    with 15 years of expected life remaining, a quality repair should last those remaining 15 years. We warranty
                                    our workmanship for 5-10 years depending on the repair type.

                                    A: Yes, we offer financing options for repairs over $1,000. This helps Sterling Heights homeowners address
