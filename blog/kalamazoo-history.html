                <!-- Introduction -->
                <section class="content-section">
                    <p class="lead-paragraph">Kalamazoo's distinctive name comes from a Native American word meaning "boiling water" or "place where the water boils," referring to bubbling springs. From this poetic origin, Kalamazoo evolved through multiple identities: agricultural center, Celery Capital, paper mill town, and pharmaceutical manufacturing hub—always adapting while maintaining small-city charm.</p>

                    <p>As Kalamazoo's local roofing experts since 2009, Elite Roofing is proud to serve this vibrant community. We've worked throughout Kalamazoo's diverse neighborhoods, from historic Stuart to Westwood, protecting homes in this university town and manufacturing center.</p>

                    <h2>Early Settlement & Founding (1829-1850)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1829 - Settlement Founded</h3>
                        <p>Titus Bronson established the first permanent European-American settlement along the Kalamazoo River. The area was initially called "Bronson" after its founder.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Before European settlement, the Kalamazoo River valley was inhabited by various Native American peoples, particularly the Potawatomi. The river and surrounding prairies provided excellent hunting, fishing, and agriculture. The name "Kalamazoo" comes from the Potawatomi language, though the exact meaning remains debated among historians.</p>

                    <p>Titus Bronson's difficult personality led to conflicts with other settlers. In 1836, residents voted to rename the settlement "Kalamazoo," rejecting association with the contentious founder. This early democratic decision reflected the community's independent spirit.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1838 - Village Incorporated</h3>
                        <p>Kalamazoo was officially incorporated as a village, establishing formal government. The settlement was growing as Michigan statehood (1837) brought increased settlement to the region.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Early Kalamazoo developed as an agricultural center. The rich prairie soil produced excellent crops, and the Kalamazoo River provided waterpower for mills and transportation. The Michigan Central Railroad's arrival in 1846 connected Kalamazoo to Detroit and Chicago, spurring commercial growth.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1851 - City Charter</h3>
                        <p>Kalamazoo received its city charter with a population exceeding 4,000. The city was establishing itself as a regional agricultural and commercial center.</p>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <!-- Celery Capital Era -->
                <section class="content-section" id="celery-capital">
                    <h2>Celery Capital Era (1850-1900)</h2>

                    <p>What truly distinguished Kalamazoo in the late 19th century was an unexpected agricultural specialty: celery.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1856 - Celery Cultivation Begins</h3>
                        <p>Dutch immigrant farmers discovered that Kalamazoo's unique muck soil in former wetlands produced exceptional celery. The vegetable, considered a delicacy in that era, thrived in local conditions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Kalamazoo celery became famous nationwide for its quality and flavor. By the 1880s, Kalamazoo was known as the "Celery City," shipping celery across America. Farmers developed specialized growing and blanching techniques that made Kalamazoo celery the premium brand.</p>

                    <p>The celery industry attracted Dutch immigrants who possessed agricultural expertise and strong work ethic. These families established farms in the celery belt around Kalamazoo, creating a cultural influence that persists in the region's Dutch Reformed churches and community values.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Celery Vending Machines</h3>
                            <p>At the industry's peak, Kalamazoo had celery vending machines! Fresh celery was considered a health food and fashionable snack, making it worthy of automated sales.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Agricultural Innovation</h3>
                            <p>The celery industry drove agricultural innovation, irrigation development, and marketing techniques that benefited Kalamazoo's broader economy.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Beyond celery, Kalamazoo developed diverse industries. Paper mills along the Kalamazoo River produced paper products. Manufacturing firms produced windmills, stoves, carriages, and machinery. By 1900, Kalamazoo had evolved from agricultural town to diversified manufacturing city.</p>

                    <h2>Industrial Growth (1900-1960)</h2>

                    <p>The 20th century transformed Kalamazoo into a significant manufacturing center while celery farming declined due to California competition and changing tastes.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1902 - Upjohn Company Expands</h3>
                        <p>The Upjohn Company, founded in 1886 by Dr. William E. Upjohn, grew into a major pharmaceutical manufacturer. Upjohn's innovative "friable pill" (easily dissolved) revolutionized medicine and established Kalamazoo as a pharmaceutical center.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Upjohn became Kalamazoo's largest employer and most influential company. The corporation's growth brought jobs, attracted educated workers, and funded civic improvements. The Upjohn family's philanthropy shaped Kalamazoo's character, funding parks, hospitals, and cultural institutions.</p>

                    <p>Paper manufacturing flourished along the Kalamazoo River. Companies like Kalamazoo Paper Company and Bryant Paper Company employed thousands, producing printing paper, cardboard, and specialty papers. The paper industry's prosperity built middle-class neighborhoods and downtown commercial districts.</p>

                            <h3>Western Michigan University (1903)</h3>
                            <p>Founded as Western State Normal School to train teachers, the institution grew into Western Michigan University. WMU's presence added educational, cultural, and economic dimensions to Kalamazoo.</p>

                            <p>One of America's oldest colleges, "K College" established Kalamazoo's educational tradition. Its innovative K-Plan foreign study program became nationally recognized.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>World War II brought defense manufacturing to Kalamazoo. Factories produced aircraft parts, military vehicles, and equipment. Post-war prosperity brought suburban expansion and continued manufacturing growth through the 1950s.</p>

                        <h3>1959 - Kalamazoo Mall Created</h3>
                        <p>Kalamazoo created America's first outdoor pedestrian shopping mall, closing several downtown blocks to vehicles. This innovative urban planning drew national attention and temporarily revitalized downtown shopping.</p>

                    <h2>Modern Development (1960-Today)</h2>

                    <p>The late 20th century brought challenges and adaptations as manufacturing changed and competition intensified.</p>

                    <p>Paper mills began closing in the 1970s-1980s as industry consolidated and environmental regulations tightened. The Kalamazoo River suffered pollution from decades of industrial waste, requiring extensive cleanup efforts. However, pharmaceutical manufacturing remained strong, cushioning Kalamazoo from the complete industrial collapse affecting other Michigan cities.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1995 - Upjohn Merges with Pharmacia</h3>
                        <p>Upjohn merged with Sweden's Pharmacia, becoming Pharmacia & Upjohn. While maintaining significant Kalamazoo operations, the merger ended Upjohn's era as an independent local company. Later mergers created Pfizer's Kalamazoo operations.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Despite pharmaceutical industry consolidation, Kalamazoo maintained substantial biotech and pharmaceutical employment. Pfizer, Zoetis (animal health), and other companies continued operating major facilities, preserving Kalamazoo's pharmaceutical identity.</p>

                            <h3>Economic Diversification</h3>
                            <p>Beyond pharmaceuticals, Kalamazoo developed healthcare services, education, and manufacturing diversity. Stryker Corporation, a medical device manufacturer, became a major employer with global reach.</p>

                            <p>The Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, Kalamazoo Symphony, and craft beer scene (Bell's Brewery founded 1985) enriched cultural life, making Kalamazoo attractive beyond employment opportunities.</p>

                        <p>Anonymous donors established the Kalamazoo Promise, offering free college tuition to Kalamazoo Public Schools graduates. This unprecedented program attracted families, stabilized neighborhoods, and became a national model for education philanthropy.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Kalamazoo Promise transformed the city. Home values increased, enrollment grew, and the program demonstrated that major philanthropy could revitalize urban education. Other cities studied the model, making Kalamazoo a leader in educational innovation.</p>

                    <p>Today's Kalamazoo balances manufacturing heritage with modern diversification. With a population of approximately 75,000 (and over 260,000 in the metro area), Kalamazoo offers small-city charm with urban amenities, strong employment, and quality education—positioning itself as one of Michigan's most livable mid-size cities.</p>
