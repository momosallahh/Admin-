                            <p>Detroit's weather is tough on roofs - ice dams, heavy snow, summer storms. Before closing, invest in a professional roof inspection from Elite Roofing. We'll identify issues that general inspectors might miss, potentially saving you $5,000-$15,000 in unexpected repairs.</p>

                            <p>Buying in Indian Village, Boston-Edison, or other historic districts? Renovations require Historic District Commission approval. This includes roof replacements - you may need to maintain specific materials and colors. Elite Roofing navigates these requirements regularly.</p>

                            <p>Many Detroit homes are priced to reflect needed updates. Budget realistically for roof, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing upgrades. A $150,000 house might need $30,000-$50,000 in systems updates to reach modern standards.</p>

                            <p>Downtown workers love Midtown and Corktown's walkability. Suburban job commuters prefer northwest neighborhoods near I-96 and Telegraph. Map your daily drive before committing.</p>
