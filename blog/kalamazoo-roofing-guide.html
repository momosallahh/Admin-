                <section class="content-section" id="common-issues">
                    <h2>Common Roofing Problems in Kalamazoo</h2>

                    <p>Based on our experience serving Kalamazoo homeowners, these are the most frequent roofing issues in Southwest Michigan:</p>

                    <h3>1. Lake-Effect Snow Load Stress</h3>
                    <p>Kalamazoo receives 65-70 inches of snow annually, with lake-effect bands capable of dropping several feet in 24-48 hours. This creates significant structural stress.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Proper roof pitch (minimum 6:12 for snow shedding), enhanced structural support where needed, and snow removal planning for extreme events. Metal roofing excellent for snow management.</p>

                    <h3>2. Ice Dams from Heavy Snowfall</h3>
                    <p>The combination of heavy lake-effect snow and temperature fluctuations creates ideal conditions for severe ice dams.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Superior attic insulation (R-49 minimum), comprehensive ventilation system, ice & water shield on all eaves and valleys. Heat cables for chronic problem areas.</p>

                    <h3>3. Wind Damage from Lake Michigan Systems</h3>
                    <p>Southwest Michigan gets powerful wind systems year-round, particularly during winter storms and summer severe weather.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> High-wind rated shingles (110+ mph minimum, 130+ mph preferred), proper installation with 6-nail pattern, sealed shingles, reinforced flashing.</p>

                    <h3>4. Historic Home Roofing Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Kalamazoo's beautiful historic neighborhoods (Stuart, Vine, Oakwood) feature complex Victorian roof designs requiring specialized attention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Period-appropriate materials with modern underlayment, custom flashing for turrets and dormers, experienced contractors familiar with historic preservation requirements.</p>

                    <h3>Historic District Considerations:</h3>
                    <p>Homes in Kalamazoo's local historic districts (Stuart Neighborhood, Oakwood, portions of Vine) may require approval from the Historic District Commission for visible roofing changes. The commission reviews material selection, color, and architectural compatibility. Applications reviewed monthly. Allow 30-45 days for approval. Many period-appropriate materials available that meet both historic and modern performance standards.</p>

                    <h3>Western Michigan University Area:</h3>
                    <p>Properties near WMU campus may have rental-specific requirements. Ensure all work meets city code for rental properties if applicable.</p>
