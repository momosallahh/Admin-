                        <h3>July 24, 1701 - Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit Founded</h3>
                        <p>French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac established Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit along the Detroit River, marking the official founding of the city. The name "détroit" means "strait" in French, referring to the river connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Before European arrival, the region was inhabited by various Native American tribes, including the Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Wyandot peoples. The Detroit River served as a critical waterway for indigenous trade networks spanning the Great Lakes.</p>

                    <p>Cadillac arrived with approximately 100 French soldiers and workers, along with 100 Algonquian and 6,000 Miami people allied with France. The settlement quickly became a vital fur trading center, with French colonists establishing ribbon farms along the Detroit River—long, narrow plots extending from the waterfront inland.</p>

                            <h3>French Period (1701-1760)</h3>
                            <p>Detroit served as a strategic military and fur trading outpost. The settlement weathered conflicts between French and British colonial forces, Native American uprisings, and harsh frontier conditions.</p>

                            <p>Following France's defeat in the French and Indian War, Britain took control of Detroit in 1760. The city endured Pontiac's War in 1763, when allied Native American forces besieged the fort for five months.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Despite officially becoming American territory after the Revolutionary War in 1783, British forces didn't surrender Detroit until 1796, making it one of the last British strongholds in the newly formed United States.</p>

                        <h3>1805 - The Great Fire</h3>
                        <p>On June 11, 1805, a devastating fire destroyed nearly every building in Detroit. The city adopted the motto "Speramus Meliora; Resurget Cineribus" (We hope for better things; it will arise from the ashes), which remains Detroit's motto today.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Judge Augustus B. Woodward designed an ambitious rebuilding plan inspired by Washington D.C., featuring broad avenues radiating from circular plazas. While the full plan was never completed, Woodward Avenue and Campus Martius Park remain as testaments to this vision.</p>

                    <p>The War of 1812 brought more upheaval when Detroit was surrendered to British forces in August 1812 without a fight—a humiliating defeat that American forces avenged by recapturing the city in 1813. This victory established American control of the Great Lakes and secured Detroit's place in the United States.</p>

                            <p>Detroit's strategic location made it a crucial hub for Great Lakes shipping. Steamboats brought waves of settlers heading west, and the city's population grew from 1,422 in 1820 to 21,019 by 1850.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>Detroit became a major terminus of the Underground Railroad. Its proximity to Canada—just a mile across the river to freedom—made it the final stop for thousands of enslaved people seeking liberty.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>By 1860, Detroit had evolved from a frontier outpost into a thriving commercial city with shipbuilding, iron foundries, and manufacturing beginning to take root alongside traditional trade.</p>

                <!-- Industrial Boom -->
                <section class="content-section" id="industrial-boom">
                    <h2>Industrial Boom (1860-1920)</h2>

                    <p>The late 19th century transformed Detroit from a commercial town into an industrial powerhouse. The city's access to iron ore from Michigan's Upper Peninsula, coal from nearby Ohio, and efficient water transportation created ideal conditions for manufacturing.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1860s-1890s - Stove Capital of the World</h3>
                        <p>Detroit became the world's leading producer of stoves and heating equipment. Companies like Detroit Stove Works employed thousands and established the city's reputation for quality manufacturing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The city's industrial base diversified rapidly. Shipbuilding flourished along the Detroit River. The railroad industry brought machine shops and foundries. Pharmaceutical companies like Parke-Davis (founded in Detroit in 1866) pioneered modern drug manufacturing.</p>

                    <p>Immigration waves dramatically changed Detroit's character. Germans, Irish, Poles, Italians, and Eastern Europeans arrived to work in factories, creating distinct ethnic neighborhoods. By 1900, Detroit's population exceeded 285,000—a 1,100% increase from 1860.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1896 - Birth of the Automobile Age</h3>
                        <p>Charles Brady King drove Detroit's first automobile down Woodward Avenue on March 6, 1896. Four months later, Henry Ford test-drove his first "Quadricycle." The automotive age had begun, and Detroit would become its capital.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Between 1900 and 1920, dozens of automobile companies emerged in Detroit, including Ford Motor Company (1903), Buick (1903), Cadillac (1902), and Chrysler (1925). Detroit's skilled machinists, established manufacturing infrastructure, and entrepreneurial spirit made it the natural center of this revolutionary industry.</p>

                        <p>Henry Ford's introduction of the moving assembly line at Highland Park Plant reduced Model T production time from 12 hours to 93 minutes, revolutionizing manufacturing worldwide.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The $5 workday Ford introduced in 1914 (double the prevailing wage) attracted workers from across America and around the world. The Great Migration brought hundreds of thousands of African Americans from the South seeking factory jobs and escape from Jim Crow oppression.</p>

                    <p>Detroit's population exploded from 465,000 in 1910 to 1.85 million by 1950, making it America's fourth-largest city. The 1920s roared particularly loud in Detroit, where automotive wealth funded spectacular Art Deco skyscrapers, ornate movie palaces, and grand mansions.</p>

                            <p>The Fox Theatre (1928), Guardian Building (1929), and Fisher Building (1928) showcased Detroit's architectural ambition. Paradise Valley became a vibrant center of African American culture and jazz.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Post-war prosperity peaked in the 1950s. Detroit's automakers dominated global markets, union jobs provided middle-class wages, and the city gleamed with modern optimism. The 1950 census recorded Detroit's all-time peak population of 1,849,568.</p>

                    <p>The 1960s began Detroit's painful transformation. White flight to suburbs accelerated, draining the city's tax base. Automation reduced factory employment. Foreign competition challenged Detroit automakers' dominance.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>July 1967 - The 12th Street Riot</h3>
                        <p>A police raid on an unlicensed bar sparked five days of civil unrest that left 43 dead, 1,189 injured, and 2,000+ buildings destroyed. The riot accelerated population decline and disinvestment, marking a tragic turning point in Detroit's history.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Population loss continued relentlessly. The 1970 census showed 1.5 million residents—a 10% decline from 1960. The 1980 census: 1.2 million. By 2000: 951,000. Detroit had lost nearly half its peak population.</p>

                    <p>Economic challenges mounted. The 1973 oil crisis devastated American automakers. Japanese competition captured market share. Plants closed, jobs disappeared. The 1980s brought crack cocaine and violent crime, giving Detroit an unwanted reputation as America's "Murder Capital."</p>

                            <p>Henry Ford II led construction of the Renaissance Center to symbolize Detroit's renewal. While architecturally impressive, it struggled to reverse downtown's decline for decades.</p>

Neighborhoods like Indian Village and Palmer Woods preserved architectural treasures. Sports teams—Tigers, Lions, Red Wings, Pistons—kept civic pride alive.</p>

                    <h2>Modern Renaissance (2000-Today)</h2>

                    <p>The 21st century brought Detroit to its lowest point—and sparked an unexpected revival. The 2008 financial crisis nearly destroyed the auto industry. Chrysler and General Motors declared bankruptcy in 2009, saved only by federal intervention.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>July 18, 2013 - Municipal Bankruptcy</h3>
                        <p>Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy with $18-20 billion in debt, the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history. Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr negotiated a painful but necessary restructuring.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Paradoxically, bankruptcy freed Detroit to rebuild. Pension obligations were restructured, the city invested in basic services, and private investment accelerated. Young entrepreneurs and artists, attracted by cheap real estate and creative energy, began moving downtown and to neighborhoods like Corktown and Midtown.</p>

                            <p>Technology companies, healthcare institutions, and creative industries joined traditional manufacturing. Detroit became a growing center for mobility innovation, including electric and autonomous vehicles.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Major developments transformed the skyline: Little Caesars Arena (2017), the refurbished Michigan Central Station (2023), and numerous residential conversions. The QLine streetcar reconnected neighborhoods. Crime rates fell significantly.</p>

                    <p>Today's Detroit tells two stories simultaneously: continued challenges in many neighborhoods facing abandonment and disinvestment, and genuine revival in downtown, Midtown, Corktown, and other areas. Population stabilized around 640,000, with growth in young professionals and families choosing Detroit for its affordability, culture, and potential.</p>

                    <p>Detroit's resilience—its refusal to surrender despite decades of challenges—has become its defining modern characteristic. The city that invented mass production and Motown is reinventing itself once again.</p>

                    <p>Many of Detroit's historic homes still stand today, showcasing architectural styles from Italianate and Queen Anne Victorian to Tudor Revival, Art Deco, and Mid-Century Modern.

                    <p>These homes feature original craftsmanship including slate roofs, decorative tile work, leaded glass windows, and ornate woodwork. The mansions built by automotive barons in the 1910s-1920s remain among America's finest examples of luxury residential design.</p>
