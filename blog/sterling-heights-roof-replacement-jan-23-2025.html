                        <div class="signs-grid">

                                <h4>📅 Age (20+ Years)</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Most architectural shingles last 25-30 years in Sterling Heights' climate. If your roof is 20+ years old,
                                    replacement should be planned even if no obvious problems exist. Many homes in Sterling Heights Meadows and
                                    established neighborhoods are reaching this critical age.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>🌪️ Missing/Damaged Shingles</h4>
                                <p>
                                    After severe storms, check for missing, cracked, or curling shingles. Widespread damage (more than 25-30% of
                                    roof) usually means replacement makes more financial sense than extensive repairs, especially if the roof is
                                    15+ years old.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="sign-item glass-card">
                                <h4>💧 Multiple Leaks</h4>
                                <p>
                                    One leak might warrant repair, but multiple leaks in different areas indicate systemic failure. Water stains
                                    on ceilings in multiple rooms suggest your roof has reached the end of its serviceable life.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>⚫ Granule Loss</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Check gutters for excessive granules (looks like coarse black sand). Granule loss exposes the asphalt layer
                                    to UV damage and accelerates deterioration. Widespread granule loss means shingles are failing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Sagging indicates structural problems with decking or rafters, often from long-term water damage. This requires
                                    immediate attention and typically full replacement with decking repairs.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While ice dams can form on any roof, repeated severe ice damming suggests inadequate ventilation and insulation.
                                    Roof replacement provides opportunity to upgrade these systems and prevent future problems.
                                </p>

                                    Instead of code-minimum (first 3 feet), we recommend full coverage for Sterling Heights homes. Adds $800-$1,500

                                    Ridge vents combined with proper soffit ventilation creates continuous airflow that extends shingle life,
                                    prevents ice dams, and reduces cooling costs by 20-30%. Critical upgrade for homes lacking proper ventilation.

                                    Class 4 impact-resistant shingles offer superior hail protection and often qualify for insurance discounts

                            <h4>What to Expect When Selling Your Sterling Heights Home</h4>
                            <p>
                                According to Remodeling Magazine's Cost vs. Value Report, roof replacement returns approximately 60-70% of its
                                cost at resale in the Metro Detroit market. However, the real value goes beyond pure ROI:
                            </p>

                            <ul class="roi-benefits">
                                <li><strong>Faster Sales:</strong> Homes with new roofs sell 30-40% faster than comparable homes needing roofs</li>
                                <li><strong>Negotiating Power:</strong> No roof concessions needed - buyers can't demand $10,000+ credits</li>
                                <li><strong>Better Offers:</strong> Pristine condition commands premium prices in Sterling Heights' competitive market</li>
                                <li><strong>Inspection Confidence:</strong> New roof with transferable warranty eliminates major inspection concerns</li>
                                <li><strong>Curb Appeal:</strong> New shingles dramatically improve first impressions and online listing photos</li>
                                <li><strong>FHA/VA Approval:</strong> No financing issues - damaged roofs can kill government-backed loans</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                For Sterling Heights' $210,000 median home, a $12,000 roof replacement often returns $7,000-$9,000 in added value,
                                plus faster sale and better terms. If you're planning to sell within 5 years, new roof is highly recommended.

                                <h4>Q: How long does roof replacement take in Sterling Heights?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A: Most Sterling Heights homes are completed in 2-4 days. A typical 1,500 sq ft ranch takes 2-3 days, while
                                    larger colonials may take 3-5 days. Weather can extend timelines, but we work efficiently to minimize
                                    disruption. Your home is weatherproof every night.

                                <h4>Q: What's the best time of year to replace a roof in Sterling Heights?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A: Late spring through fall (May-October) offers optimal conditions. Summer provides best shingle sealing temps.
                                    However, we work year-round and can complete quality installations during mild winter periods when necessary.
                                    Book early for peak season (June-September) to secure preferred timing.

                                    A: Not necessarily. After initial consultation and material selection, we can complete installation while you're
                                    at work. We'll need access to electricity and water, but homeowner presence isn't required. Perfect for FCA

                                <h4>Q: Will my homeowners insurance cover roof replacement?</h4>
                                <p>
                                    A: Insurance covers sudden damage (storms, hail, wind, fallen trees) but not normal wear and age. If your roof
                                    has storm damage, we'll inspect, document, and help file your claim. Our insurance specialists work directly
                                    with adjusters to maximize coverage.

                                    A: We bring samples to your home and show you options in natural light. Consider your siding, brick, and
                                    neighborhood aesthetics. Neutral tones (grays, browns, weathered wood) are most popular in Sterling Heights
                                    and offer broad appeal for future resale.
