                            <p>Unlike many districts, Troy School District is excellent throughout - no "bad" schools. Focus on home features and location rather than specific school boundaries. All neighborhoods deliver quality education.</p>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🔍 Premium Roof Inspection Worth It</h3>
                            <p>Troy homes are valuable investments. Elite Roofing's detailed inspection examines not just shingle condition but ventilation, ice dam potential, and system longevity. On a $500k+ home, comprehensive roof knowledge is essential.</p>

                            <h3>💼 Corporate Relocations Common</h3>
                            <p>Troy attracts corporate relocations, creating steady turnover. Work with experienced agents who understand corporate buyers. Homes near major employers (Big Beaver corridor) may command premiums.</p>

                            <p>Newer subdivisions offer modern amenities but smaller lots. Established neighborhoods (Historic Village area) provide mature trees and larger lots but may need systems updates including roofing. Budget accordingly.</p>

                            <p>Troy's excellent services come with higher property taxes. Calculate total ownership costs including taxes (2-3% of value annually). Factor this into budget alongside mortgage and insurance.</p>

                            <p>Troy offers excellent freeway access (I-75, I-696, M-59). Test your commute during rush hour. Some neighborhoods provide easier access to specific freeways - consider your daily route.</p>
