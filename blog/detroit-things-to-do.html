                        <h2>1. Detroit Institute of Arts</h2>
                        <p>The Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) ranks among America's finest art museums, housing over 65,000 artworks spanning centuries and continents. The crown jewel is Diego Rivera's "Detroit Industry Murals," a masterpiece depicting Detroit's manufacturing heritage. The museum's Beaux-Arts architecture is stunning, and admission is free for residents of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties thanks to voter-approved millage. Plan at least 3-4 hours to explore the extensive collections. While you're admiring the DIA's magnificent architecture and intricate ceiling details, you might appreciate how proper building maintenance preserves such historic treasures – the same care Detroit homeowners should give their roofs.</p>

                        <p>This 982-acre island park in the Detroit River is a true urban oasis designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the same landscape architect behind New York's Central Park. Belle Isle offers incredible diversity: the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory with exotic plants, the Belle Isle Aquarium (America's oldest), the James Scott Memorial Fountain, beaches, hiking trails, and spectacular city skyline views. Rent bikes, enjoy a picnic, or simply relax by the water. The island requires a Michigan Recreation Passport for entry.

Every Saturday, the market explodes with energy as local farmers, artisans, and food vendors fill the historic sheds with fresh produce, flowers, specialty foods, and handmade goods. The surrounding murals make it one of the world's largest outdoor art galleries. Don't miss Russell Street Deli for amazing sandwiches or Supino Pizzeria for Detroit-style pizza. The market operates year-round with indoor winter hours. Beyond Saturday's main market, visit Tuesday for a smaller farmers market and explore the permanent shops and restaurants that operate all week.</p>

                        <h2>14. Corktown Historic District</h2>
                        <p>Corktown is Detroit's oldest neighborhood, established by Irish immigrants in the 1840s. Today, it's one of the city's trendiest areas, mixing historic charm with modern vitality. Michigan Central Station, Ford's massive renovation project, dominates the skyline and symbolizes Detroit's revival. Explore vintage shops, hip cafes, and acclaimed restaurants along Michigan Avenue. Don't miss Slows Bar BQ for award-winning barbecue, Batch Brewing Company for craft beer, or Sugar House for craft cocktails. The neighborhood features beautifully restored Victorian homes that showcase period architecture – these historic homes require specialized roofing care to preserve their character while providing modern protection.</p>
