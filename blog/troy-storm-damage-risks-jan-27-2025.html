                        <h2>Understanding Storm Risks for Troy's $300,000+ Homes</h2>
                        <p>
                            Troy, Michigan homeowners face unique storm damage challenges that can significantly impact their
                            substantial property investments. With median home values around $300,000 and premium neighborhoods
                            like Northfield Hills and Somerset featuring even higher-value properties, understanding and
                            preventing storm damage is crucial for protecting your investment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Troy receives approximately 40 inches of snow annually and experiences Michigan's full range of
                            weather extremes including ice dams, heavy snow loads, severe wind storms, and summer hail events.
                            This comprehensive guide details the specific storm risks Troy homeowners face and proven protection
                            strategies backed by 25+ years of local roofing experience.

                        <h3>⛈️ Major Storm Threats in Troy, Michigan</h3>

                        <div class="storm-threat glass-card featured">
                            <h4>1. Ice Dams (November - March)</h4>
                            <p class="risk-badge">Risk Level: VERY HIGH</p>

                            <div class="threat-details">
                                <h5>What Are Ice Dams?</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Ice dams form when snow on your roof melts from heat escaping through the attic, runs down
                                    to the cold roof edge, and refreezes. This creates an ice barrier that traps melting snow,
                                    forcing water under shingles and into your home. In Troy's upscale neighborhoods, ice dam
                                    damage frequently causes $5,000-$15,000+ in repairs to ceilings, walls, insulation, and
                                    personal property.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Why Troy Homes Are Vulnerable:</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Complex Roof Designs:</strong> Many Troy homes feature multiple valleys, dormers, and architectural details that trap snow</li>
                                    <li><strong>Large Footprints:</strong> 2,500-4,000+ sq ft homes mean more attic space and potential heat loss</li>
                                    <li><strong>Older Homes:</strong> Many 1970s-1990s homes have inadequate attic insulation (R-30 vs. current R-49 standard)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Insufficient Ventilation:</strong> Improper soffit/ridge vent balance allows heat accumulation</li>
                                    <li><strong>40" Annual Snowfall:</strong> Consistent snow cover creates ideal ice dam conditions</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5>Warning Signs of Ice Dams:</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Icicles forming along roof edges (especially large, thick icicles)</li>
                                    <li>Ice buildup in gutters despite ambient temperatures above freezing</li>
                                    <li>Water stains on ceilings or walls near exterior walls</li>
                                    <li>Sagging gutters from ice weight</li>
                                    <li>Damaged or missing shingles discovered in spring</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h5>Prevention Strategies:</h5>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Upgrade Attic Insulation:</strong> Minimum R-49 for Troy climate, prevents heat loss to roof deck</li>
                                    <li><strong>Improve Ventilation:</strong> Balanced soffit and ridge vents maintain cold attic temperature</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ice & Water Shield:</strong> Premium underlayment 3-6 feet up from eaves (code requires 2 feet minimum)</li>
                                    <li><strong>Metal Drip Edge:</strong> Prevents water infiltration at roof edges</li>
                                    <li><strong>Professional Snow Removal:</strong> Remove heavy accumulation before melting begins</li>
                                    <li><strong>Heat Cable Systems:</strong> Strategic placement in valleys and along eaves for severe cases</li>
                                    <li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Fall inspection ensures insulation and ventilation are optimal</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <p><strong>Average Ice Dam Damage Cost:</strong> $8,000 - $15,000</p>
                                    <p><strong>Prevention Cost:</strong> $3,000 - $5,000 (insulation + ventilation upgrades)</p>
                                    <p><strong>ROI:</strong> Prevention pays for itself after preventing just one major ice dam event</p>

                                <p>
                                    Troy's 40 inches of average annual snowfall can create dangerous weight on roofs, especially
                                    during heavy, wet snow events. A cubic foot of wet snow weighs 15-20 pounds. A 2,000 sq ft
                                    roof with 2 feet of wet snow carries 30-40 TONS of weight. While modern Troy homes are built
                                    to code, older homes, flat sections, and areas with poor drainage face structural risks.
                                </p>

                                    <li>Sagging ceiling or roof deck (visible from attic or outside)</li>
                                    <li>Interior doors that stick or won't close properly</li>
                                    <li>Cracking or popping sounds from roof structure</li>
                                    <li>Windows or doors becoming difficult to open</li>
                                    <li>Cracks appearing in interior walls or ceilings</li>
                                    <li>Water leaking where walls meet ceilings</li>

                                    <li>Low-slope or flat roof sections</li>
                                    <li>After ice storms (ice is extremely heavy)</li>
                                </ul>

                                    Troy's proximity to the Great Lakes means powerful wind events can reach 60-70+ mph, especially
                                    during spring and fall storms. High winds lift and tear shingles, damage flashing, and can
                                    send debris into your roof causing punctures and structural damage.

                                    <li><strong>Complex Roof Lines:</strong> Multiple planes and angles create wind uplift zones</li>
                                    <li><strong>Aged Shingles:</strong> 15+ year old roofs lose wind resistance</li>

                                    Troy experiences 15-20 hail events annually, mostly during summer thunderstorms. While most are
                                    small (pea-sized), severe storms can produce golf ball to baseball-sized hail causing extensive
                                    roof damage. Hail damage often isn't visible from the ground but compromises shingle integrity,
                                    shortens roof lifespan, and can void warranties if not addressed promptly.

                                    While less frequent than winter storms, Troy's summer weather brings intense thunderstorms with
                                    lightning, high winds, torrential rain, and occasional tornado warnings. Oakland County averages
