                            <h3>🔍 Roof Inspection Essential</h3>
                            <p>Many Lansing homes are 50+ years old with original or aging roofs. Elite Roofing's pre-purchase inspection identifies problems general inspectors miss - ice dam damage, inadequate ventilation, worn shingles. Knowing roof condition helps negotiating and budgeting.</p>

                            <p>Lansing vs. East Lansing vs. Waverly schools can mean different property values. Research carefully - East Lansing and Waverly command premiums for schools. Lansing Public Schools has improving magnet programs worth considering.</p>
