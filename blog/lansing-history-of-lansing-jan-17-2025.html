                        <h2>Lansing: Michigan's Seat of Power</h2>
                        <p>
                            Lansing's history is unique among American state capitals - chosen by political compromise,
                            built from wilderness, and shaped by both government and automotive innovation. From a
                            frontier settlement to Ransom Olds' birthplace of the automobile industry to today's stable
                            capital city, Lansing has played a crucial role in Michigan and American history.
                        </p>

                        <h3>🌲 Early Settlement (1830s-1847)</h3>
                        <div class="history-section glass-card">
                            <h4>Wilderness Beginnings</h4>
                            <p>
                                In 1835, two brothers - John and Joseph North - arrived in the Grand River valley,
                                finding dense forests, native wildlife, and rich soil. They established the first
                                permanent settlement in what would become Lansing.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Early Development:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1835:</strong> North brothers build first cabin</li>
                                <li><strong>1837:</strong> Michigan achieves statehood (Detroit is capital)</li>
                                <li><strong>1842:</strong> Village laid out and platted</li>
                                <li><strong>1847:</strong> Just 20 residents in the settlement</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Frontier Life</h4>
                            <p>
                                Early settlers cleared forests, built log cabins, and established farms. The Grand River
                                provided water power for mills and transportation. Life was harsh, isolated, and challenging.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>🏛️ The Great Capital Compromise (1847)</h3>
                        <div class="history-section glass-card">
                            <h4>Political Maneuvering</h4>
                            <p>
                                Michigan's 1835 constitution required moving the capital from Detroit to a more central
                                location by 1847. Multiple cities competed: Ann Arbor, Jackson, Marshall, and Grand Rapids
                                all lobbied intensely. The legislature deadlocked in bitter debate.
                            </p>

                            <h4>The Compromise Solution</h4>
                            <p>
                                In a brilliant political move, Representative Joseph Kilbourne proposed Lansing - then
                                called "Michigan" township - as a compromise. His arguments:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Central location in Lower Peninsula</li>
                                <li>No city had home-field advantage (neutrality)</li>
                                <li>Room to build a proper capital from scratch</li>
                                <li>Less political corruption than established cities</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>March 1847: Capital Designation</h4>
                            <p>
                                The legislature voted to make Lansing the state capital. Many legislators expected the
                                decision to be reversed - Lansing was barely a settlement, no buildings suitable for
                                government, and primitive conditions. But the decision stuck.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Building the Capital (1847-1850)</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1847:</strong> First temporary capitol building constructed (wooden structure)</li>
                                <li><strong>1848:</strong> Legislature meets in Lansing for first time</li>
                                <li><strong>1849:</strong> Village officially named "Lansing" after Lansing, New York</li>
                                <li><strong>1859:</strong> Incorporated as a city</li>
                                <li><strong>1879:</strong> Current State Capitol completed (still in use today)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                                Railroads transformed Lansing from isolated capital to connected city:

                                Beyond government, Lansing developed manufacturing base:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                        <div class="history-section glass-card">
                            <h4>Lansing's Automotive Pioneer</h4>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Ransom Eli Olds</strong> is one of history's most underrated inventors. While
                                Henry Ford gets more recognition, Olds was America's true automotive pioneer - and he
                                did it in Lansing.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Key Achievements:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1887:</strong> Olds builds first experimental gasoline-powered vehicle</li>
                                <li><strong>1897:</strong> Olds Motor Vehicle Company founded in Lansing (first in Michigan!)</li>
                                <li><strong>1901:</strong> Curved Dash Oldsmobile - America's first mass-produced car</li>
                                <li><strong>1904:</strong> REO Motor Car Company founded (Ransom E. Olds)</li>
                                <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Assembly line production (before Ford)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Lansing Becomes Auto City</h4>
                            <p>
                                Olds's success attracted other automotive companies:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>REO Motor Car Company:</strong> Automobiles and trucks</li>
                                <li><strong>Oldsmobile:</strong> Eventually moved to Lansing (produced here until 2004)</li>
                                <li><strong>Numerous suppliers:</strong> Parts manufacturers and support industries</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Economic Impact</h4>
                            <p>
                                Automotive manufacturing transformed Lansing from small government town to industrial city:
                            </p>
                            <table>

                            <p>
                                Like Detroit, Lansing's auto plants converted to war production:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>
                                The automotive industry faced major challenges:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            <p>
                                Despite challenges, Lansing's auto industry survived and modernized:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                While auto faced challenges, state government employment provided stability. Unlike
                                Detroit's decline, Lansing's capital status ensured economic foundation.
