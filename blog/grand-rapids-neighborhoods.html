                            <h3>❄️ Roof Inspection is Critical</h3>
                            <p>West Michigan's lake-effect snow and ice can devastate roofs. Elite Roofing's pre-purchase inspections examine ice dam potential, ventilation, and shingle condition - critical factors general inspectors often miss. Don't close without a specialized roof inspection.</p>

                            <p>East Grand Rapids commands premium prices for its schools. However, Grand Rapids Public Schools has excellent magnet and charter programs - research your options thoroughly. School choice can save you $100k+ on home price.</p>

                            <p>Grand Rapids is very bikeable and walkable for a Michigan city. If working downtown, test your commute during rush hour. Eastown and Heritage Hill residents often bike year-round, saving on parking and gas.</p>

                            <p>City of Grand Rapids vs. East Grand Rapids have different tax rates. Calculate total ownership costs including taxes, insurance, and anticipated maintenance. Sometimes a cheaper house costs more long-term.</p>
