                    <h2>Early Settlement & Lumber Era (1819-1880)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1819 - First Settlement</h3>
                        <p>Jacob Smith established a fur trading post on the Flint River, becoming the area's first permanent European-American settler. The settlement was named for the Flint River, which Native Americans called "Pawanunking."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Before European settlement, the region was inhabited by various Native American peoples, particularly the Ojibwe and Potawatomi. The Flint River provided transportation and fish, while the surrounding forests offered abundant game and resources. The river's name came from the flint stones found along its banks.</p>

                    <p>Early Flint developed slowly as a trading and agricultural center. The Flint River provided waterpower for grist and sawmills. By the 1830s, the settlement had grown to include several dozen families engaged in farming, trading, and small-scale manufacturing.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1855 - City Charter</h3>
                        <p>Flint was incorporated as a city with a population of approximately 3,000. The city was growing as Michigan's lumber industry exploded.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The mid-to-late 19th century brought lumber boom prosperity. Michigan's vast pine forests attracted lumber companies, and Flint's location on the Flint River made it ideal for processing logs floated down from northern forests. Lumber mills lined the riverbanks, and the city's population grew rapidly.</p>

                    <p>By 1880, Flint had become a prosperous lumber town with over 8,000 residents. However, the lumber supply was finite, and forward-thinking entrepreneurs began developing new industries to sustain the city's economy. What came next would transform Flint into an industrial powerhouse.</p>

                <!-- Carriage Manufacturing Boom -->
                <section class="content-section" id="carriage-industry">
                    <h2>Carriage Manufacturing Boom (1880-1910)</h2>

                    <p>As Michigan's forests were depleted, Flint entrepreneurs pivoted to carriage manufacturing, using their woodworking expertise to build horse-drawn vehicles. This transition would prove crucial to Flint's next chapter.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1880s - "Vehicle City" Emerges</h3>
                        <p>Flint became known as "Vehicle City" for its production of horse-drawn carriages and wagons. Companies like Durant-Dort Carriage Company became the world's largest carriage manufacturer, producing over 50,000 vehicles annually by 1900.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>William Crapo "Billy" Durant, who would later found General Motors, started as a cigar salesman before entering the carriage business with J. Dallas Dort. Durant-Dort became wildly successful, employing thousands and establishing Flint as America's carriage capital.</p>

                    <p>The carriage industry created skilled workers, developed supply chains, and built manufacturing expertise—all of which would prove invaluable when the horseless carriage arrived. Flint's woodworkers, painters, upholsterers, and metalworkers possessed exactly the skills needed for automobile manufacturing.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Skilled Workforce</h3>
                            <p>By 1900, Flint had thousands of skilled craftsmen experienced in vehicle manufacturing. This workforce made Flint attractive to the emerging automobile industry.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Entrepreneurial Culture</h3>
                            <p>The success of Durant and other carriage manufacturers created an entrepreneurial culture and business networks that facilitated the transition to automotive manufacturing.</p>

                <!-- GM Era -->
                <section class="content-section" id="gm-era">
                    <h2>General Motors Era (1908-1970)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1908 - General Motors Founded in Flint</h3>
                        <p>Billy Durant founded General Motors Company in Flint on September 16, 1908, consolidating Buick Motor Company with other automakers. This moment would define Flint's identity for the next century.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Durant had already acquired Buick Motor Company in 1904, moving it to Flint and transforming it into a major automaker. GM's founding consolidated multiple car companies under one corporation, creating what would become the world's largest automaker.</p>

                    <p>Flint exploded with growth. The city's population soared from 38,550 in 1910 to 91,599 by 1920 and 156,492 by 1930. Workers flooded in from across America and around the world, attracted by high-paying factory jobs. GM plants sprawled across the city, and everything revolved around automotive manufacturing.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1936-1937 - Flint Sit-Down Strike</h3>
                        <p>One of American labor history's most significant events occurred in Flint when United Auto Workers organized a sit-down strike at GM plants. After 44 days, GM recognized the UAW, transforming labor relations in America and establishing union rights in the automotive industry.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The sit-down strike's success made Flint synonymous with labor power. The UAW's victory established pattern bargaining that brought middle-class wages to industrial workers nationwide. Flint's autoworkers became some of America's best-paid factory employees.</p>

                    <p>Post-World War II decades represented Flint's golden age. GM plants operated at capacity, employment was abundant, and union wages provided comfortable middle-class lives. Flint built new schools, parks, libraries, and the Flint Cultural Center—a collection of museums, theaters, and educational facilities unmatched in cities of similar size.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Peak Prosperity (1950s-1960s)</h3>
                            <p>Flint's population peaked at 196,940 in 1960. The city boasted excellent schools, thriving downtown, beautiful neighborhoods, and optimistic residents enjoying American prosperity.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Cultural Investment</h3>
                            <p>The Mott Foundation, established by GM executive Charles Stewart Mott, invested hundreds of millions in Flint's education, culture, and community facilities, creating institutions that remain today.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>However, beneath prosperity lurked vulnerabilities. Flint's economy depended almost entirely on GM. When automotive fortunes changed, Flint would face devastating consequences.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Industrial Decline -->
                <section class="content-section" id="decline">
                    <h2>Industrial Decline (1970-2000)</h2>

                    <p>The 1970s began Flint's painful decline as automation, foreign competition, and GM's changing strategies devastated the city's economic foundation.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1970s-1980s - Plant Closures Begin</h3>
                        <p>GM began closing Flint plants, moving production to newer facilities in other states and countries. Each closure meant thousands of lost jobs and ripple effects throughout the economy.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Population loss became relentless. The 1970 census showed 193,317 residents—already declining from the 1960 peak. By 1980: 159,611. By 1990: 140,761. By 2000: 124,943. Flint had lost over 70,000 residents in four decades, with more decline to come.</p>

                    <p>The economic devastation was total. As GM jobs disappeared, supporting businesses closed. Downtown emptied as suburban malls drew shoppers away. Crime soared as unemployment and poverty spread. Homes were abandoned, neighborhoods declined, and the tax base collapsed.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1989 - "Roger & Me" Documentary</h3>
                        <p>Michael Moore's documentary "Roger & Me" chronicled GM plant closures and Flint's decline, making the city a symbol of American deindustrialization. The film brought international attention to Flint's struggles.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Despite efforts to diversify—including the controversial AutoWorld theme park (1984-1992) that failed spectacularly—Flint couldn't replace lost automotive jobs. The city tried tourism, entertainment, and other alternatives, but nothing could compensate for tens of thousands of lost manufacturing positions.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Persistent Challenges</h3>
                            <p>High unemployment, poverty, crime, and population loss created cascading problems. Flint led Michigan in violent crime rates during the 1990s, and abandoned homes spread across neighborhoods.</p>

                            <p>Despite decline, Flint retained assets: the Mott Foundation, University of Michigan-Flint, Kettering University, excellent healthcare systems, and dedicated residents refusing to abandon their city.</p>

                    <h2>Modern Challenges & Resilience (2000-Today)</h2>

                    <p>The 21st century brought Flint to national attention for the worst possible reason, yet also revealed the community's extraordinary resilience.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>2014-2019 - Flint Water Crisis</h3>
                        <p>In April 2014, the city switched its water source to the Flint River to save money. Improperly treated water leached lead from aging pipes, poisoning residents—especially children—with toxic lead exposure. The crisis became a national scandal exposing government failures and environmental injustice.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The water crisis devastated Flint's already struggling community. Residents couldn't drink tap water for years, relying on bottled water. Children suffered lead poisoning with lifelong consequences. Trust in government shattered. National media portrayed Flint as a failed city.</p>

                    <p>Yet the crisis also revealed resilience. Residents organized to demand clean water. Community groups distributed bottled water and filters. Medical professionals documented lead exposure. National attention brought resources and support. Slowly, painfully, Flint began replacing lead pipes and restoring water quality.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Recovery Efforts</h3>
                            <p>By 2024, most lead service lines had been replaced, water quality improved significantly, and state/federal support funded health programs for affected children. Recovery continues, though effects persist.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Community Strength</h3>
                            <p>Flint residents demonstrated remarkable resilience, organizing mutual aid, advocating for justice, and refusing to abandon their city despite overwhelming challenges.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Today's Flint faces continued challenges—poverty, population loss (down to approximately 81,000 by 2020), abandoned properties—but also shows signs of renewal. Downtown has seen investment in new businesses and housing. Young people are returning to contribute to revival. The Flint Farmers Market thrives as a community hub.</p>

                    <p>Flint's story isn't over. The city that built General Motors and stood up to it in 1937 is fighting for a new future, showing that resilience and community strength can overcome even the most devastating setbacks.</p>
