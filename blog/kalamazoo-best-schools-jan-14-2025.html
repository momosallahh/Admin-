                        <h3>💡 Choosing the Right School in Kalamazoo</h3>
                        <div class="tips-list glass-card">
                            <h4>Key Considerations:</h4>

                            <h5>✓ Kalamazoo Promise Eligibility</h5>
                            <p>
                                If you're moving to Kalamazoo, enrolling your children in Kalamazoo Public Schools early
                                maximizes Promise benefits. Kindergarten enrollment ensures 100% tuition coverage at
                                graduation - worth $60,000-$120,000 in college savings.
                            </p>

                            <h5>✓ School Visit Strategy</h5>
                            <p>
                                Schedule tours at multiple schools to compare facilities, meet teachers, and observe
                                classroom environments. KPS offers open enrollment within the district, so you can
                                choose the best fit for your child.
                            </p>

                            <h5>✓ Location & Housing</h5>
                            <p>
                                Top-rated elementary schools like Parkwood-Upjohn are in desirable neighborhoods
                                (Westnedge Hill, Milwood). These areas often have higher home values but excellent
                                school proximity and community engagement.
                            </p>

                            <h5>✓ Program Alignment</h5>
                            <p>
                                Match school programs to your child's interests: Maple Street Magnet for arts-focused
                                students, Loy Norrix IB program for academic challenge, Hackett Catholic Prep for
                                faith-based education.
                            </p>

                            <h5>✓ Long-Term Planning</h5>
                            <p>
                                Consider the K-12 pathway. Kalamazoo Public Schools enrollment from kindergarten through
                                high school graduation maximizes Promise benefits and creates educational continuity.
                            </p>

                        <h3>🏡 Moving to Kalamazoo for Better Schools?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Families relocate to Kalamazoo specifically for the Kalamazoo Promise and exceptional schools.
                            The combination of quality education and guaranteed college funding creates unprecedented
