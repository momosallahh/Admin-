Chef Ryan Chadwick creates dishes that celebrate Michigan's agricultural bounty with technique and creativity. Expect unexpected preparations of familiar ingredients – root vegetables become star attractions, local fish is treated with reverence, and Michigan-raised meats are butchered in-house. The tasting menu option allows the kitchen to showcase their full range of creativity. The wine list emphasizes natural and organic wines that complement the food philosophy. The intimate space creates a special-occasion atmosphere while remaining approachable. The restaurant's strong relationships with local farmers mean diners get the freshest possible ingredients prepared at their peak. Vegetarian and dietary restrictions are accommodated thoughtfully. Reservations recommended, especially for the chef's counter seats where you can watch the kitchen in action.</p>
