                            <p>Many Flint homes won't qualify for conventional mortgages without repairs. Cash buyers can negotiate steep discounts, renovate (including new roof), then refinance or sell. This strategy builds substantial equity quickly.</p>

                            <p>College Cultural and Carriage Town offer mansion-scale historic homes under $100k. These require renovation budgets but create stunning homes. Prioritize roofing, electrical, plumbing - Elite Roofing handles the critical protective envelope.</p>
