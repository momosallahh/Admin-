                <section class="content-section" id="common-issues">
                    <h2>Common Roofing Problems in Sterling Heights</h2>

                    <p>Based on our extensive experience serving Sterling Heights homeowners, these are the most frequent roofing issues:</p>

                    <h3>1. Storm Damage from Severe Weather</h3>
                    <p>Sterling Heights experiences frequent severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and occasional hail, particularly during summer months.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> High-wind rated shingles (110+ mph minimum) properly installed with adequate fasteners. Impact-resistant shingles protect against hail and qualify for insurance discounts. Post-storm inspections catch damage early.</p>

                    <h3>2. Ice Dam Formation</h3>
                    <p>Many Sterling Heights homes, particularly ranches and split-levels common in older subdivisions, are vulnerable to ice dams during winter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Proper attic insulation (R-49 minimum for Michigan), balanced ventilation systems, ice & water shield on all eaves and valleys. Preventive measures far less expensive than damage repairs.</p>

                    <h3>3. Ventilation Issues in Older Homes</h3>
                    <p>Homes built in the 1960s-1980s often lack adequate roof ventilation, leading to premature shingle failure and moisture problems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Modern ventilation retrofits with ridge vents and soffit vents. Dramatically extends shingle life, improves energy efficiency, prevents ice dams. Essential upgrade during roof replacement.</p>

                    <h3>4. Aging Roofs Nearing Replacement</h3>
                    <p>Many Sterling Heights homes have roofs approaching 20-25 years old, the typical lifespan of original shingles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional inspection determines remaining life. Proactive replacement before failure prevents emergency situations and water damage. Modern materials offer better performance and longer warranties.</p>

                    <h2>Storm Damage Prevention Tips</h2>

                    <p>Sterling Heights' location in Macomb County brings frequent severe weather. Protect your roof with these strategies:</p>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🔍 Regular Inspections</h3>
                            <p>Schedule professional inspection annually - spring after winter, fall before snow season. Early detection of issues prevents expensive repairs. Post-storm inspections catch damage while fresh. Many contractors offer free initial inspections.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>❄️ Ice Dam Prevention</h3>
                            <p>Ensure adequate attic insulation (R-49 minimum). Keep attic vents clear of insulation blockage. Install ice & water shield during replacement. Heat cables for chronic problem areas. Prevention far cheaper than repair.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🍃 Gutter Maintenance</h3>
                            <p>Clean gutters twice yearly minimum (spring and fall). Many Sterling Heights homes have mature landscaping requiring more frequent cleaning. Gutter guards reduce maintenance burden. Proper drainage protects foundation and basement.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>💨 Wind Damage Protection</h3>
                            <p>High-wind rated shingles essential for severe weather common in area. Proper installation with 6 nails per shingle standard. Sealed shingles prevent wind uplift. Regular inspection catches loose shingles before they blow off.</p>

                            <p>Class 4 impact-resistant shingles provide excellent protection. Macomb County experiences periodic hailstorms. Small upfront investment protects roof and qualifies for 10-25% insurance discounts.</p>
