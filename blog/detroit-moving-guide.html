                    <h2>🚗 Transportation</h2>

                    <p>Detroit is a car-dependent city, though recent improvements to public transit and downtown walkability are changing that for some neighborhoods.</p>

                        <h3>🚌 Getting Around Detroit</h3>

                            <li><strong>Major Highways:</strong> I-94, I-75, I-96, M-10 (Lodge Freeway)</li>

                            <li><strong>Walkability:</strong> High in Downtown, Midtown, Corktown; low elsewhere</li>
                            <li><strong>Bike-Friendly:</strong> Improving with new bike lanes and MoGo bike share system</li>
                            <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Generally abundant and affordable ($5-$15 downtown)</li>

                    <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> Most Detroit residents need a car. Winter weather, sprawling layout, and limited transit make car ownership essential for most neighborhoods. Budget for reliable winter transportation and snow tires.</p>

                    <p>Before closing on your Detroit home, a thorough inspection is crucial - especially for the roof. Michigan's harsh weather takes a toll on roofing systems, and many Detroit homes are 50-100+ years old.</p>
