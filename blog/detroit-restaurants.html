                        <p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> New American | <strong>Price:</strong> $$$ | <strong>Best For:</strong> Date Night, Special Occasions</p>
                        <p>Selden Standard has become Detroit's crown jewel of contemporary dining, earning national acclaim for chef Andy Hollyday's seasonal small plates that showcase Michigan ingredients at their finest. The open kitchen anchors a sophisticated yet approachable space where communal tables and intimate booths coexist beautifully. Signature dishes rotate with the seasons but expect creative preparations like wood-fired vegetables, house-made pastas, and expertly sourced proteins. The cocktail program rivals the food for creativity, featuring craft spirits and house-made ingredients. Located in Midtown's vibrant corridor, the restaurant embodies Detroit's culinary renaissance. Book reservations well in advance, especially for weekend evenings, as this consistently ranks among Michigan's best restaurants.</p>

                        <p>Grey Ghost delivers bold, innovative cuisine in a hip warehouse setting that perfectly captures Detroit's industrial-chic aesthetic. Chef John Vermiglio creates unexpected flavor combinations that consistently surprise and delight – think Korean-influenced dishes alongside locally sourced steaks and imaginative vegetable preparations. The bar program is equally adventurous, with craft cocktails that incorporate everything from house-made shrubs to smoked ingredients. The open kitchen allows diners to watch the culinary magic unfold. Weekend brunch here is legendary, featuring creative benedicts and inventive breakfast cocktails. The restaurant occupies a beautifully renovated space that shows how historic Detroit buildings can be transformed while honoring their character – much like Elite Roofing's approach to protecting and preserving Detroit homes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Italian | <strong>Price:</strong> $$-$$$ | <strong>Best For:</strong> Pasta Lovers, Groups</p>
                        <p>SheWolf has revolutionized Italian dining in Detroit with their focus on house-made pasta and wood-fired dishes inspired by Rome's cuisine. Chef Anthony Lombardo's pastas are extraordinary – from classic cacio e pepe to innovative seasonal creations that showcase local ingredients within an Italian framework. The Roman-style pizzas emerge from the wood-fired oven with perfectly charred, airy crusts. Start with the fritto misto or roasted vegetables, then dive into multiple pasta courses to share. The wine list emphasizes Italian selections that pair beautifully with the food. The industrial-modern space features an open pasta-making area where you can watch fresh pasta being crafted daily. The energetic atmosphere and shareable menu make it perfect for groups celebrating special occasions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 350 Monroe St, Detroit (Downtown) | <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Order multiple pastas to share</p>

                        <p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Detroit-Style Pizza | <strong>Price:</strong> $$ | <strong>Best For:</strong> Families, Casual Dining, Detroit Icons</p>
                        <p>Buddy's didn't just perfect Detroit-style pizza – they invented it in 1946, and they've been serving square pies with caramelized cheese edges ever since. The signature style features a thick, airy crust baked in blue steel pans, Wisconsin brick cheese spread edge-to-edge (creating those coveted crispy corners), and sauce ladled on top of toppings. The Detroiter – loaded with pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions – remains the most popular order. Beyond pizza, their antipasto salad is legendary among locals. Multiple locations serve metro Detroit, with the original Conant Street location offering the most nostalgic atmosphere. This is essential Detroit eating – casual, satisfying, and distinctly local. No visit to Detroit is complete without experiencing this Motor City original.</p>

                        <p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Classic Coney Dogs | <strong>Price:</strong> $ | <strong>Best For:</strong> Late Night, Quick Bites, Detroit Tradition</p>
                        <p>The legendary Lafayette Coney Island has been serving Detroit's signature dish since 1924, maintaining a friendly rivalry with American Coney Island next door. A Detroit coney dog features an all-beef hot dog topped with beanless chili, yellow mustard, and diced white onions – simple but perfected over decades. Lafayette's chili has a distinctive texture and flavor that locals fiercely defend as superior. The no-frills counter service and vintage atmosphere transport you to another era. Open 24 hours most days, it's equally popular for late-night cravings and weekend breakfast (try the coney omelete). At just a few dollars per dog, you can afford to order multiples and join the debate about whether Lafayette or American serves the better coney. This is Detroit food culture at its most authentic and accessible.</p>

                        <p>Takoi brings vibrant Thai street food flavors to Detroit's Corktown neighborhood with creative interpretations that honor tradition while embracing local ingredients. The menu changes seasonally but features small plates designed for sharing – think green papaya salad with Michigan apples, whole fried fish with tamarind sauce, and inventive curry variations. The drink program showcases Thai-inspired cocktails alongside natural wines and craft beers. The compact space fills quickly with diners drawn to the bold flavors and energetic atmosphere. Chef Brad Greenhill's approach balances authenticity with creativity, resulting in dishes that feel both familiar and surprising. Portions are generous for the price point, making it easy to sample widely across the menu.

                        <p>Amar showcases the rich culinary traditions of Lebanon and the broader Middle East in an elegant setting that elevates the dining experience while keeping prices accessible. The menu features mezze platters perfect for sharing – hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, and fattoush salad all shine with fresh ingredients and authentic preparation. Main courses include expertly grilled kebabs, lamb preparations, and seafood dishes seasoned with traditional spice blends. The restaurant also excels with vegetarian options, offering dishes that prove plant-based Middle Eastern cuisine rivals any protein-centered meal. Weekend brunch adds creative twists to traditional dishes. The warm, sophisticated atmosphere makes it suitable for both casual dinners and special celebrations. Generous portions and moderate prices make it excellent for groups wanting to sample widely across the menu.</p>

                        <p>Chartreuse has become Detroit's brunch destination, serving creative breakfast and lunch dishes in an upscale but welcoming environment. Chef Doug Hewitt's menu balances comfort food appeal with refined technique – the crab cake benedict, duck confit hash, and seasonal pancakes consistently impress. The cocktail program extends beyond mimosas to include creative morning drinks and classic cocktails executed with precision. Dinner service offers equally appealing options for those seeking an evening meal. The elegant interior features rich colors and sophisticated design that elevate the dining experience without feeling stuffy. Service is attentive and knowledgeable, guiding diners through seasonal menu changes and drink pairings. Located in the vibrant Midtown area, it's worth the typical weekend wait.

                        <p>Slows Bar BQ helped put Detroit's Corktown neighborhood on the culinary map when it opened in 2005, and it remains one of the city's most popular restaurants. The slow-smoked meats are the star – fall-off-the-bone ribs, juicy pulled pork, and beef brisket that rivals any barbecue joint in America. The Reason sandwich (pulled pork with coleslaw on Texas toast) has achieved legendary status among locals. Creative sides like mac and cheese, baked beans, and cornbread round out the menu. The industrial-casual space features communal tables that encourage a convivial atmosphere. Craft beer selection showcases Michigan breweries. Weekend waits can be long, but the food is worth it.

                        <p><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Detroit-Style Pizza | <strong>Price:</strong> $ | <strong>Best For:</strong> Lunch, Casual Dining, Pizza Lovers</p>
                        <p>Supino Pizzeria serves exceptional Detroit-style pizza in the heart of Eastern Market, earning a devoted following for their perfectly executed pies at remarkably fair prices. Unlike Buddy's thick crust, Supino offers a lighter, crispier take on Detroit-style with creative topping combinations that change seasonally. The Bismarck pizza topped with mozzarella, fontina, arugula, prosciutto, and a fried egg has achieved cult status. The simple, focused menu ensures everything is done well – choose from signature pizzas or build your own with high-quality toppings. The compact space fills quickly during lunch and weekend market days. Cash-only policy keeps prices low (there's an ATM nearby). The casual counter-service format means you can grab an amazing pizza without the wait or expense of a full-service restaurant. This is pizza craftsmanship at its finest, served without pretension in Detroit's most vibrant market district.</p>
                        <p><strong>Location:</strong> 2457 Russell St, Detroit (Eastern Market) | <strong>Note:</strong> Cash only; arrive before noon on Saturdays</p>
