                    <h2>🚗 Transportation</h2>

                    <p>Kalamazoo is moderately car-dependent with improving public transit and good walkability in certain neighborhoods. The city is compact and easy to navigate.</p>

                    <div class="info-card glass-card">
                        <h3>🚌 Getting Around Kalamazoo</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Public Transit:</strong> Kalamazoo Metro Transit (good routes, free fares!)</li>
                            <li><strong>Major Highways:</strong> I-94, US-131</li>
                            <li><strong>Airport:</strong> Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International (AZO) - 15 minutes</li>
                            <li><strong>Walkability:</strong> Good downtown and near colleges, moderate elsewhere</li>
                            <li><strong>Bike-Friendly:</strong> Expanding bike lane network, Kalamazoo River Valley Trail</li>
                            <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Generally easy and affordable, even downtown</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>Kalamazoo's free public transit is a major advantage. Most residents own cars for convenience, but downtown and college-area residents can function without them. Winter weather makes bikes challenging December-March.</p>
