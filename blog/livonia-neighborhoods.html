                            <p>Livonia Public Schools maintain quality throughout the district - no need to obsess over specific elementary boundaries. Focus on home features, location, and price rather than chasing particular schools.</p>

                            <h3>🔍 Roof Inspection Important</h3>
                            <p>Many Livonia homes are 40-60 years old with aging roofs. Elite Roofing's pre-purchase inspection identifies whether you need immediate replacement or have years remaining. This knowledge is critical for negotiating and budgeting.</p>
