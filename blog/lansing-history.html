                    <p class="lead-paragraph">Lansing's story is unique among Michigan cities—it became the state capital not through natural prominence but through political compromise, then transformed itself into an industrial powerhouse while maintaining its governmental role. From wilderness settlement to automotive manufacturing hub, Lansing has written a distinctively American story of adaptation and growth.</p>

                    <h2>Early Settlement (1835-1847)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1835 - First Settlers Arrive</h3>
                        <p>The area that would become Lansing was virtually wilderness when the first European-American settlers arrived in the mid-1830s. The Grand River and Red Cedar River confluence attracted pioneers seeking fertile farmland.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Before settlement, the region was inhabited by various Native American peoples, particularly the Ojibwe and Odawa. The rivers provided transportation and fish, while the surrounding forests offered hunting and resources. Treaties in the 1830s opened the land for American settlement.</p>

                    <p>Early settlers established farms and small mills along the rivers. The settlement was initially called "Michigan" or "Biddle City," but neither name stuck. Growth was slow—by 1840, the area had only a few dozen families scattered across the wilderness.</p>

                    <p>What would transform this obscure frontier settlement into Michigan's capital came not from natural advantages but from political maneuvering and compromise in Detroit's halls of power.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Becoming the Capital -->
                <section class="content-section" id="capital-city">
                    <h2>Becoming the Capital (1847-1900)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>March 1847 - Designated State Capital</h3>
                        <p>The Michigan Legislature voted to move the state capital from Detroit to Lansing Township—a decision that shocked nearly everyone. Lansing had virtually no buildings, no infrastructure, and barely existed as a settlement.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Why Lansing? Political compromise. Detroit wanted to keep the capital, but outstate legislators wanted it moved to a more central location. Grand Rapids and other established cities competed, but none could gain majority support. Lansing Township was selected as a neutral compromise—so remote that it offended no one's local pride.</p>

                    <p>The decision sparked frantic development. Workers rushed to construct a temporary capitol building before the legislature's 1848 session. The first capitol, a simple wood-frame structure, was completed in record time. Legislators arrived to find a frontier village with muddy streets and minimal accommodations.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1855 - City Incorporated as "Lansing"</h3>
                        <p>The growing settlement was officially incorporated as the City of Lansing, establishing municipal government and formal boundaries. The population had grown to approximately 3,000.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Government employment attracted residents, and services developed to support the capital. Hotels, restaurants, law offices, and printing shops opened downtown. The permanent State Capitol building, completed in 1879, remains one of America's finest capitol buildings, with its ornate Victorian architecture and towering dome.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Railroad Arrival (1850s)</h3>
                            <p>Rail connections transformed Lansing from isolated outpost to connected city. The Detroit & Milwaukee Railway and other lines linked the capital to Michigan's growing cities and eastern markets.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Industrial Development</h3>
                            <p>Beyond government, Lansing developed industries including lumber mills, agricultural equipment manufacturing, and wagon works. The rivers provided waterpower, and rail transported goods to markets.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>By 1900, Lansing had transformed from wilderness to established city. The capital designation had succeeded beyond expectations, creating a stable economic base that would support future growth.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1897 - Ransom E. Olds Founds Olds Motor Vehicle Company</h3>
                        <p>Lansing native Ransom E. Olds founded what became Oldsmobile, making Lansing one of America's first automotive manufacturing cities—even before Detroit's automotive boom.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Curved Dash Oldsmobile, introduced in 1901, became America's first mass-produced automobile. By 1904, Oldsmobile was producing 5,000 cars annually—an astounding number for the era. Lansing transformed from government town to industrial city almost overnight.</p>

                    <p>Automotive manufacturing brought waves of workers. The city's population exploded from 16,485 in 1900 to 31,229 by 1910 and 78,397 by 1920. New neighborhoods sprang up to house factory workers, creating the diverse residential areas that characterize Lansing today.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1908 - General Motors Acquires Oldsmobile</h3>
                        <p>GM's purchase of Oldsmobile deepened Lansing's automotive roots. The company expanded operations, building new plants and establishing Lansing as a major GM manufacturing center alongside Detroit and Flint.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Reo Motor Car Company, also founded by Ransom Olds after leaving Oldsmobile, became Lansing's second major automaker. At its peak, REO employed thousands and produced cars, trucks, and eventually military vehicles.</p>

                            <p>Automotive prosperity funded downtown development, new neighborhoods, schools, and parks. Lansing enjoyed stable employment from both government and manufacturing—a unique economic mix that cushioned economic downturns.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">

                            <p>Lansing's factories converted to war production, manufacturing military vehicles, aircraft parts, and munitions. The Oldsmobile plant alone produced thousands of aircraft components and artillery shells.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Post-war decades brought continued growth. Suburban expansion created new neighborhoods. The opening of Michigan State University's main campus in nearby East Lansing added educational and cultural dimensions to the greater Lansing area.</p>

                <section class="content-section" id="modern-challenges">
                    <h2>Modern Challenges & Adaptation (1960-2000)</h2>

                    <p>The late 20th century brought challenges familiar to Michigan's industrial cities: automation, foreign competition, and manufacturing decline. However, Lansing's dual economy—government and automotive—provided more stability than single-industry cities.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1970s-1980s - Plant Closures Begin</h3>
                        <p>REO Motor Car Company's truck division closed in 1975, ending an era. GM began consolidating operations, and employment at Lansing plants declined through automation and efficiency improvements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Downtown Lansing faced challenges common to American cities: suburban flight, shopping mall competition, and urban decay. The vibrant downtown of the 1950s struggled as residents and businesses moved to suburbs and outlying areas.</p>

                    <p>However, Lansing adapted better than many Michigan cities. State government employment remained stable, providing economic ballast. The presence of Michigan State University in neighboring East Lansing added educational and healthcare employment. The cities' economic diversity prevented the complete collapse experienced elsewhere.</p>

                    <h2>21st Century Renaissance (2000-Today)</h2>

                    <p>The 21st century brought unexpected renewal to Lansing's automotive sector and downtown revival that transformed the capital city.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>2001 - Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant Opens</h3>
                        <p>GM invested $650 million in a state-of-the-art assembly plant, replacing aging facilities. This commitment demonstrated GM's continued faith in Lansing's workforce and secured automotive manufacturing's future in the capital.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The 2008-2009 automotive crisis threatened Lansing's plants, but the city survived bankruptcy and restructuring. GM maintained significant operations, producing popular vehicles including the Cadillac CT4, CT5, and Chevrolet Traverse.</p>

                    <p>Downtown Lansing experienced genuine renaissance. The Cooley Law School Stadium (2009, later Jackson Field) brought minor league baseball to the riverfront. Residential conversions brought residents downtown. Restaurants, breweries, and entertainment venues opened, creating vibrancy unseen since the 1950s.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">

                            <p>The Lansing Art Gallery, Impression 5 Science Center, and revitalized Riverwalk created cultural attractions. The city embraced arts and entertainment as economic development tools.</p>

                            <p>Lansing has become increasingly diverse, welcoming immigrant and refugee populations from Latin America, Asia, and Africa. This diversity enriches the community and creates new economic energy.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Today's Lansing balances its dual identity as capital city and manufacturing center. With a population of approximately 112,000 (and over 460,000 in the metro area), Lansing offers stable employment, affordable housing, and improving quality of life—positioning itself for continued growth in Michigan's future.</p>

                    <h2>Lansing's Historic Homes & Architecture</h2>

                    <p>Many of Lansing's historic homes still stand today, particularly in older neighborhoods near downtown and along tree-lined streets developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These homes feature Victorian, Colonial Revival, Craftsman, and Foursquare styles, reflecting the eras when government workers, automotive managers, and Lansing's professional class built family residences.</p>

                    <p>The historic neighborhoods near the State Capitol showcase particularly fine examples of period architecture, with homes featuring original details including decorative shingles, wraparound porches, stained glass, and quality craftsmanship.</p>
