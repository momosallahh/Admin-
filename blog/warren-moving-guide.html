                            <strong>Strong Negotiating Power:</strong> MANY Warren homes need immediate roof replacement. Use detailed inspection findings to negotiate aggressively - request full roof replacement credit ($7,000-$10,000) or significant price reduction. Sellers in Warren's market often accept because roof issues are common and expected.
