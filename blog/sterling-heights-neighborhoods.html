                            <p>Sterling Heights spans three districts: Utica (best rated), Warren Consolidated (solid), and small portion of Van Dyke. Research boundaries carefully - Utica areas command premium prices for schools. Verify exact district before buying.</p>

                            <p>Many Sterling Heights homes are 40-50 years old with aging roofs. Elite Roofing's pre-purchase inspection identifies remaining roof life and potential issues. On affordable homes, a needed roof replacement significantly impacts your total investment.</p>
