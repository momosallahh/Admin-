                    <h2>Early Settlement & Founding (1826-1850)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1826 - Louis Campau Establishes Trading Post</h3>
                        <p>French-Canadian trader Louis Campau built a trading post and cabin near the rapids of the Grand River, establishing the first permanent European settlement. He purchased land from the federal government for $90—the site of today's downtown Grand Rapids.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Before European arrival, the Grand River valley was inhabited by the Odawa (Ottawa) people, who called the area "Owashtenong." The river's rapids provided excellent fishing, and the surrounding forests offered abundant hunting. Odawa leader Chief Noonday initially welcomed traders, though relations would become complex as more settlers arrived.</p>

                    <p>Reverend Isaac McCoy established a Baptist mission nearby in 1825, serving both Native Americans and arriving settlers. The mission attracted more pioneers, and by 1831, the village had grown enough to warrant a post office.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1838 - Village Incorporated as "Grand Rapids"</h3>
                        <p>The settlement was officially named for the mile-long rapids of the Grand River that provided waterpower for early mills. The rapids would define the city's industrial character for decades to come.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Early industry centered on the river. Grist mills processed wheat from Michigan's agricultural interior. Sawmills cut timber from the surrounding forests. The completion of the Grand River Navigation improvements in the 1840s connected Grand Rapids to Lake Michigan, opening markets for local goods.</p>

                            <p>Grand Rapids received its city charter with a population of approximately 2,700. The city was growing rapidly as Michigan's timber industry exploded and transportation improved.</p>

                            <p>The arrival of the Detroit & Milwaukee Railway in 1858 transformed Grand Rapids from a river town into a regional hub, connecting it to Detroit, Chicago, and beyond.</p>

                <section class="content-section" id="lumber-era">
                    <h2>Lumber Boom Era (1850-1890)</h2>

                    <p>The mid-19th century brought explosive growth fueled by Michigan's lumber industry. Grand Rapids' location on the Grand River made it an ideal processing center for logs floated down from northern forests. By 1870, Grand Rapids was Michigan's third-largest city.</p>

                    <p>Lumber mills lined the riverbanks, and the city's population swelled with workers drawn by industrial jobs. German and English immigrants arrived first, followed by Irish, Polish, and Scandinavian workers. These diverse communities created distinct neighborhoods that shaped Grand Rapids' character.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1870s - Birth of the Furniture Industry</h3>
                        <p>As lumber poured through Grand Rapids, enterprising craftsmen began turning raw timber into finished furniture. The abundance of quality hardwood, skilled workers, and rail connections created perfect conditions for furniture manufacturing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876 proved transformative. Grand Rapids furniture makers exhibited their products and won recognition for quality and craftsmanship. The phrase "Grand Rapids furniture" became synonymous with American quality furniture manufacturing.</p>

                    <p>By 1880, furniture had surpassed lumber as Grand Rapids' leading industry. Dozens of furniture factories employed thousands of workers, from skilled carvers and finishers to assembly workers. The city earned its lasting nickname: "Furniture Capital of America."</p>

                            <h3>Heritage Hill Development</h3>
                            <p>As furniture barons and lumber magnates prospered, they built magnificent homes on the hill east of downtown. Heritage Hill became one of America's finest Victorian neighborhoods, with homes showcasing Italianate, Queen Anne, and Romanesque architecture.</p>

                            <p>The concentration of industrial workers made Grand Rapids a center of labor organizing. The 1911 furniture workers' strike, though ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrated workers' growing power and demands for better conditions.</p>

                    <h2>Furniture Capital of America (1890-1960)</h2>

                    <p>The late 19th and early 20th centuries represented Grand Rapids' golden age of furniture manufacturing. The city's factories produced everything from ornate Victorian bedroom sets to modern office furniture, earning a reputation for quality that reached worldwide.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1900-1920 - Peak Furniture Production</h3>
                        <p>At its height, Grand Rapids had over 40 major furniture factories employing more than 6,000 workers. The semi-annual Furniture Market attracted buyers from across America and Europe, making Grand Rapids a center of design innovation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Companies like Berkey & Gay, Sligh Furniture, and Imperial Furniture Company became household names. The industry's success generated wealth that funded cultural institutions including museums, parks, and schools.</p>

                    <p>The early 20th century brought architectural expansion. Downtown boasted new skyscrapers including the McKay Tower (1915) and the Pantlind Hotel (1913, later Amway Grand Plaza). Movie palaces like the Regent Theatre showcased Grand Rapids' prosperity.</p>

                    <div class="info-grid">
                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>World War II Production</h3>
                            <p>During WWII, furniture factories converted to war production, manufacturing aircraft parts, military equipment, and medical supplies. The industrial expertise that built furniture now supported the war effort.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="info-card glass-card">
                            <h3>Post-War Expansion</h3>
                            <p>The 1950s brought suburban growth and continued prosperity. Grand Rapids annexed surrounding townships, and the metropolitan area expanded rapidly as returning veterans started families.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>However, the 1960s brought challenges. Southern states offered cheaper labor and newer factories. Foreign competition increased. Grand Rapids' furniture industry began its slow decline, though the city's reputation for quality manufacturing endured.</p>

                <section class="content-section" id="dutch-heritage">
                    <h2>Dutch Immigration & Cultural Impact</h2>

                    <p>One of Grand Rapids' most distinctive characteristics is its Dutch heritage, which profoundly shaped the city's character, values, and culture.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1840s-1920s - Waves of Dutch Immigration</h3>
                        <p>Beginning in the 1840s, Dutch immigrants fleeing economic hardship and seeking religious freedom settled in West Michigan. While Holland, Michigan, was the initial center, many Dutch families moved to Grand Rapids for factory jobs.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The Dutch brought strong work ethic, Reformed Protestant faith, and tight-knit community values. They established churches, Christian schools, and cultural organizations that remain influential today. By 1900, Grand Rapids had the largest urban Dutch population in America.</p>

                    <p>Dutch influence shaped Grand Rapids' character in lasting ways: a strong emphasis on education and faith, conservative social values, entrepreneurial spirit, and commitment to community. The city's large number of Christian schools and churches reflects this heritage.</p>

                            <p>Dutch immigrants and their descendants founded many of Grand Rapids' most successful companies, including Meijer, Amway, and Steelcase. The Dutch emphasis on hard work and innovation drove entrepreneurial success.</p>

                    <h2>Modern Growth & Diversification (1960-Today)</h2>

                    <p>As traditional furniture manufacturing declined, Grand Rapids successfully diversified its economy, avoiding the fate of many Rust Belt cities. The transformation showcased the adaptability and innovation that had always characterized Grand Rapids.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1959 - Amway Founded</h3>
                        <p>Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos founded Amway (American Way Association), which grew into a multi-billion dollar direct selling company. The DeVos and Van Andel families became major philanthropists, funding civic improvements and cultural institutions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Office furniture emerged as a modern specialty. Steelcase (founded as Metal Office Furniture Company in 1912) became the world's largest office furniture manufacturer. Herman Miller pioneered modern furniture design, working with legendary designers like Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson.</p>

                    <p>Healthcare grew into a major industry. Spectrum Health and Mercy Health systems became major employers. Medical device manufacturing and healthcare services diversified the economy beyond manufacturing.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1980s-1990s - Downtown Revitalization</h3>
                        <p>Grand Rapids invested heavily in downtown revival. The Grand Center (1980), Rosa Parks Circle (2001), and Van Andel Arena (1996) revitalized the urban core. The DeVos Place Convention Center (2004) brought major events to the city.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The 21st century brought cultural renaissance. The Grand Rapids Art Museum (2007) became the first LEED-certified art museum in the world. The city embraced its beer heritage—once a "temperance town," Grand Rapids now boasts 80+ craft breweries, earning the title "Beer City USA."</p>
