                    <h2>Early Settlement & Founding (1824-1837)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>May 25, 1824 - City Founded</h3>
                        <p>John Allen and Elisha Rumsey founded Ann Arbor as a speculative land venture. Allen named the settlement after his wife Ann, and the "arbor" referred to the area's abundant grape arbors and burr oak trees.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Before European settlers arrived, the region was inhabited by various Native American peoples, including the Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and Odawa. The Huron River provided fish and transportation, while the surrounding forests offered game and resources.</p>

                    <p>Allen and Rumsey purchased 640 acres for $800 from the federal government, betting that their settlement would become the county seat of the newly formed Washtenaw County. Their gamble paid off when Ann Arbor was designated county seat in 1826, ensuring the town's survival.</p>

                    <p>Early Ann Arbor was a typical frontier town with mills powered by the Huron River, general stores, taverns, and basic services. The town grew slowly through the late 1820s, attracting farmers, merchants, and craftsmen to the fertile Washtenaw County farmlands.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1833 - Village Incorporated</h3>
                        <p>With a population of approximately 2,000, Ann Arbor was formally incorporated as a village, establishing local government and services.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>What would truly transform Ann Arbor, however, was not agriculture or manufacturing, but a decision made in Detroit in 1837 that would define the city's identity forever.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- University of Michigan Arrives -->
                <section class="content-section" id="university-arrives">
                    <h2>University of Michigan Arrives (1837-1900)</h2>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1837 - University of Michigan Relocates to Ann Arbor</h3>
                        <p>The University of Michigan, founded in Detroit in 1817, relocated to Ann Arbor. The city donated 40 acres of land—today's Central Campus—to secure the university. Classes began in 1841 with six freshmen and two professors.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The university's arrival transformed Ann Arbor from a modest county seat into Michigan's intellectual capital. The relationship between town and gown would define Ann Arbor's character, economy, and culture for the next two centuries.</p>

                    <p>Early growth was slow. The university remained small through the 1850s, with enrollment under 500 students. The Civil War disrupted growth, with many students and faculty serving the Union cause. The Michigan Union was formed during this era, becoming one of the first student unions in America.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1870 - University Admits Women</h3>
                        <p>The University of Michigan became one of the first major universities to admit women, with Madelon Stockwell becoming the first female student. This progressive decision enhanced Ann Arbor's reputation as a forward-thinking community.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Post-Civil War decades brought rapid university expansion. Enrollment grew from under 1,000 in 1870 to over 3,000 by 1890. New buildings rose across campus, including University Hall (1872) and the original University Hospital (1891).</p>

                    <p>The university's growth fueled Ann Arbor's economy. Boarding houses, bookstores, restaurants, and services catering to students multiplied. Faculty members built homes in neighborhoods like the Old West Side, creating a residential area that blended Victorian architecture with academic culture.</p>

                            <h3>1867 - City Charter</h3>
                            <p>Ann Arbor received its city charter, formalizing municipal government and establishing the framework for managing growth. The population exceeded 7,000.</p>

                            <p>By the 1890s, Michigan had become one of America's leading research universities, particularly in medicine, engineering, and law. This reputation attracted talented students and faculty from across the nation.</p>

                    <h2>Twentieth Century Growth (1900-1960)</h2>

                    <p>The early 20th century solidified Ann Arbor's identity as a university town while also developing its own civic character. The city's population grew steadily, reaching 14,817 by 1910 and 29,815 by 1920.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1910s-1920s - Football Becomes King</h3>
                        <p>Michigan Stadium opened in 1927 with capacity for 72,000 fans (later expanded to 107,000+, making it America's largest stadium). Football Saturdays became central to Ann Arbor's identity and economy.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Beyond the university, Ann Arbor developed its own industries. The Ann Arbor Machine Company, Hoover Steel Ball Company, and other manufacturers provided non-university employment. However, the university remained the dominant economic force, growing to over 10,000 students by 1930.</p>

                    <p>The Great Depression brought challenges, but the university's stable presence cushioned Ann Arbor from the worst economic devastation affecting industrial Michigan cities. Enrollment continued growing, and federal research funding increased during the New Deal era.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>World War II Era</h3>
                        <p>The university contributed significantly to war research, including radar development and military medicine. Post-war GI Bill enrollment exploded, with veterans flooding campus and straining Ann Arbor's housing and infrastructure.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The 1950s brought suburban expansion. Neighborhoods like Burns Park developed as returning veterans started families. Shopping centers emerged on the city's periphery, though downtown remained vibrant thanks to student traffic.</p>

                            <p>Federal research funding transformed Michigan into one of the nation's premier research universities. The opening of the Phoenix Memorial Laboratory (1956) established Ann Arbor as a center for nuclear research.</p>

                            <p>The Ann Arbor Art Fair began in 1960, growing into one of the nation's largest outdoor art fairs. Cultural institutions flourished, supported by both university and community patronage.</p>

                    <h2>Counterculture & Activism (1960-1980)</h2>

                    <p>The 1960s and 1970s established Ann Arbor's reputation as a progressive, activist-oriented community. The combination of a large student population and liberal faculty created an environment receptive to social movements.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1960 - Students for a Democratic Society Founded</h3>
                        <p>The Port Huron Statement, founding document of the SDS, was drafted at a United Auto Workers retreat near Ann Arbor. The organization became central to 1960s student activism.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Anti-Vietnam War protests rocked campus and the city throughout the late 1960s. Major teach-ins, demonstrations, and civil disobedience made Ann Arbor a center of anti-war sentiment. The Black Action Movement strike in 1970 shut down the university, demanding increased African American enrollment and faculty representation.</p>

                    <p>Counterculture flourished in Ann Arbor. The city became known for progressive politics, environmental activism, and alternative lifestyles. The Ann Arbor Sun and other underground newspapers spread radical ideas. The city decriminalized marijuana possession in 1972 (later reversed), and the Hash Bash became an annual cannabis advocacy event.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Modern Era (1980-Today)</h2>

                    <p>The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw Ann Arbor evolve into a high-tech hub while maintaining its university-town character. The combination of world-class research, educated workforce, and quality of life attracted technology companies and startups.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-box glass-card">
                        <h3>1990s - Tech Boom</h3>
                        <p>Ann Arbor became a center for automotive technology, software development, and internet companies. The proximity to Detroit's automakers and the university's engineering programs created synergy in automotive innovation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Companies like Borders Books (founded in Ann Arbor in 1971), Domino's Pizza (nearby Ypsilanti), and Zingerman's Deli became nationally recognized brands originating in the Ann Arbor area. Google opened a major office in Ann Arbor, and numerous tech startups launched.</p>

                    <p>Downtown revitalization succeeded where many Michigan cities failed. State Street and Main Street remained vibrant with restaurants, bookstores, and shops serving students, residents, and visitors. The city carefully balanced development with historic preservation.</p>

                            <p>Success brought growing pains. Housing costs soared, making Ann Arbor one of Michigan's most expensive cities. The tension between growth and affordability became a central political issue.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Today's Ann Arbor balances multiple identities: Big Ten college town, high-tech hub, cultural center, and progressive community. With a population exceeding 120,000 (and 46,000+ students), Ann Arbor ranks among America's most educated and economically vibrant small cities.</p>

                    <p>The city continues innovating in sustainability, transportation, and urban planning while preserving the quirky, intellectual character that makes Ann Arbor unique in Michigan and beyond.</p>
