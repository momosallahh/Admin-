                <!-- Common Issues -->
                <section class="content-section" id="common-issues">
                    <h2>Common Roofing Problems in Livonia</h2>

                    <p>Based on our extensive experience serving Livonia homeowners, these are the most frequent roofing issues we encounter:</p>

                    <h3>1. Aging Roofs in Established Neighborhoods</h3>
                    <p>Many Livonia homes were built in the 1950s-1970s and may have original or second-generation roofs nearing end of life.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Regular inspections identify when repairs are no longer cost-effective. Modern materials offer better performance and longer life than original roofing. Proactive replacement prevents emergency situations and interior damage.</p>

                    <h3>2. Ice Dam Formation</h3>
                    <p>Ranch-style homes common in Livonia often have lower roof pitches and long eave lines, making them vulnerable to ice dams.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Proper attic insulation (R-49 minimum), balanced ventilation, ice & water shield on all eaves. Heat cables for chronic problem areas. Address before replacing roof for best results.</p>

                    <h3>3. Wind Damage from Severe Weather</h3>
                    <p>Livonia's location in Wayne County exposes homes to frequent severe thunderstorms and straight-line winds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> High-wind rated shingles properly installed with adequate fasteners. Sealed shingles prevent wind uplift. Regular inspection after major storms catches damage early.</p>

                    <h3>4. Inadequate Ventilation in Mid-Century Homes</h3>
                    <p>Many older Livonia homes lack proper roof and attic ventilation, leading to premature shingle failure and ice problems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Modern ventilation retrofits (ridge vents and soffit vents) can be added without major reconstruction. Dramatically extends shingle life and improves energy efficiency.</p>

                            <li>✓ Get 3-4 written estimates from licensed, insured contractors</li>
                            <li>✓ Architectural shingles offer best value (only slightly more than 3-tab, much longer life)</li>
                            <li>✓ Consider impact-resistant shingles for insurance discounts (ROI in 3-5 years)</li>
                            <li>✓ Don't skip ventilation upgrades - extends roof life by 5-10 years</li>
                            <li>✓ Fall timing often provides best weather and competitive pricing</li>
                            <li>✓ Financing available makes quality roofing affordable for most budgets</li>

                        <li>✓ Permits protect you - ensure work meets code and provides insurance documentation</li>

                    <h2>Storm Damage Prevention Tips</h2>

                    <p>Livonia's location in the Detroit metro brings frequent severe weather. Here's how to protect your roof:</p>

                            <h3>🔍 Annual Inspections</h3>
                            <p>Schedule professional inspection every spring to assess winter damage and prepare for summer storms. Fall inspection prepares roof for winter. Early detection prevents expensive repairs. Many contractors offer free inspections.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>❄️ Ice Dam Prevention</h3>
                            <p>Ranch homes especially vulnerable. Ensure adequate attic insulation (check local programs for assistance). Keep attic vents clear. Install ice & water shield during replacement. Prevents expensive interior damage.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🍃 Gutter Maintenance</h3>
                            <p>Clean gutters twice yearly minimum (spring and fall). Many Livonia homes have mature trees requiring more frequent cleaning. Consider gutter guards to reduce maintenance. Proper drainage prevents foundation and landscape damage.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🌳 Tree Management</h3>
                            <p>Livonia's mature neighborhoods have beautiful trees that require management. Keep branches 6+ feet from roof. Remove dead limbs before storms. Professional tree service provides peace of mind.</p>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>💨 Wind Protection</h3>
                            <p>High-wind rated shingles essential for severe weather. Proper installation with 6 nails per shingle standard. Sealed shingles prevent wind uplift. Check and secure loose shingles promptly.</p>
