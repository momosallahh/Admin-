                            <h3>📚 Schools Drive Pricing</h3>
                            <p>Ann Arbor Public Schools are excellent overall, but certain elementary zones (Burns Park, Bach, Angell) command premium prices. Research boundaries carefully - being one block off can mean $100k+ price difference.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-card glass-card">
                            <h3>🏔️ Roof Inspection Non-Negotiable</h3>
                            <p>Michigan winters are brutal on roofs. Elite Roofing's pre-purchase inspection examines ice dam risk, ventilation, shingle condition, and remaining lifespan. Many Ann Arbor homes need $8,000-$15,000 roof replacements - know before you buy.</p>

                            <h3>💰 Budget for Premium Costs</h3>
                            <p>Ann Arbor's trades are expensive - labor costs run 15-25% higher than surrounding areas. Budget accordingly for renovations, repairs, and roofing projects. Quality work costs more but protects your substantial investment.</p>

                            <h3>🚴 Walkability Premium</h3>
                            <p>Walkable neighborhoods (Old West Side, Kerrytown, Burns Park) command 20-30% premiums but save on transportation costs and offer lifestyle benefits. Calculate total cost of ownership including commuting.</p>

                            <p>Old West Side's Victorian homes are gorgeous but may need systems updates. Original knob-and-tube wiring, galvanized plumbing, and aged roofs require budgeting $50,000-$100,000 for modernization.</p>
