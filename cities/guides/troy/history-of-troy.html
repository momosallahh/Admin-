                        <h2>Troy's Transformation: 200 Years of Growth</h2>
                        <p>Troy, Michigan's evolution from rural farming community to thriving suburb of 87,000 residents represents one of the most successful transformations in American suburban history. Understanding Troy's history provides context for the city's strong community values, excellent schools, and commitment to quality of life that continue today.</p>

                        <h3>🌾 Early Settlement (1820s-1900)</h3>
                        <div class="history-period glass-card">
                            <h4>Pioneer Era</h4>
                            <p>Troy Township was organized in 1827, named after Troy, New York, by early settlers from New England. The area was primarily agricultural, with farms producing wheat, corn, and livestock for Detroit markets 20 miles south.</p>

                            <h5>Key Early Developments:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1827:</strong> Troy Township officially organized</li>
                                <li><strong>1830s:</strong> First schools established in one-room schoolhouses</li>
                                <li><strong>1840s-1850s:</strong> Plank roads built connecting Troy to Detroit</li>
                                <li><strong>Population 1900:</strong> Approximately 2,000 residents</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The community remained rural and agriculture-focused through the 19th century, with small hamlets like Big Beaver, Troy Corners, and Crooks serving as commercial centers.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>🏭 Early 20th Century (1900-1950)</h3>
                        <div class="history-period glass-card">
                            <h4>Gradual Suburbanization</h4>
                            <p>As Detroit's auto industry boomed, Troy remained largely agricultural but began seeing gradual residential development. Improved roads and automobile ownership allowed Detroit workers to consider Troy for country living.</p>

                            <h5>Key Developments:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1920s:</strong> Paved roads begin replacing dirt paths</li>
                                <li><strong>1930s:</strong> First subdivisions platted near main roads</li>
                                <li><strong>1955:</strong> Troy incorporated as city (population ~19,000)</li>
                                <li><strong>1950:</strong> Population ~11,000</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The decision to incorporate as a city in 1955 allowed Troy to control its own development and establish the foundation for planned growth.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>🏘️ Suburban Boom (1950s-1970s)</h3>
                        <div class="history-period glass-card">
                            <h4>Explosive Growth</h4>
                            <p>The post-WWII suburban boom transformed Troy from small town to thriving suburb. Thousands of families moved from Detroit seeking newer homes, good schools, and suburban lifestyle.</p>

                            <h5>Development Milestones:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1950s:</strong> Major subdivision development begins (Northfield, Somerset areas)</li>
                                <li><strong>1960:</strong> Population ~19,000</li>
                                <li><strong>1969:</strong> Big Beaver Road developed as major commercial corridor</li>
                                <li><strong>1970:</strong> Population ~39,000</li>
                                <li><strong>Troy School District:</strong> Rapid expansion, new elementary and middle schools built</li>
                                <li><strong>1969:</strong> Troy High School opens</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>This era established Troy's character as family-oriented suburb focused on quality schools and safe neighborhoods. The city's commitment to planning prevented haphazard development.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>🏢 Corporate Hub (1980s-2000s)</h3>
                        <div class="history-period glass-card">
                            <h4>Economic Diversification</h4>
                            <p>Troy evolved beyond bedroom community to become major employment and retail center. The Big Beaver corridor attracted corporate headquarters and upscale retail.</p>

                            <h5>Major Developments:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1969 (expanded 1996):</strong> Somerset Collection opens - Michigan's premier luxury mall</li>
                                <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Kmart headquarters moves to Troy</li>

                                <li><strong>2000:</strong> Population ~80,000</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Troy's transformation into employment center reduced resident commuting while increasing tax base for excellent city services and schools.</p>
