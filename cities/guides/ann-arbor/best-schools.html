                        <p>
                            Ann Arbor Public Schools consistently ranks among the top school districts in Michigan and the nation.
                            With exceptional teachers, innovative programs, and the influence of the University of Michigan,
                            Ann Arbor offers world-class education from preschool through high school. The district's proximity
                            to U-M provides unique enrichment opportunities, from university partnerships to cultural resources
                            that few communities can match.
