                            <p>
                                Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit on July 24, 1701,
                                establishing the area as a French trading post. "Détroit" means "strait" in French,
                                referring to the Detroit River connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Detroit grew as a Great Lakes shipping hub and manufacturing center. Strategic location
                                made it vital for trade between East Coast and western territories.

                                neighborhoods that still characterize Detroit today. Population grew from 21,000 (1850)
                                to 285,000 (1900).

                                New sports stadiums brought people back downtown. Casinos, restaurants, and entertainment
                                venues followed. Young professionals began moving to Midtown and downtown lofts.

                                blighted properties, and encourage development. This marked the beginning of Detroit's
                                remarkable transformation.

                            <h4>What Detroit's Story Teaches Us:</h4>

                            <h5>1. Resilience</h5>
                            <p>
                                Detroit has faced destruction by fire (1805), economic collapse, bankruptcy, and
                                population loss - yet always rebuilds stronger.
                            </p>

                            <h5>2. Innovation</h5>
                            <p>
                                From assembly line manufacturing to Motown to techno music to autonomous vehicles,
                                Detroit continuously pioneers new ideas.

                                Cities aren't defined by their lowest moments but by their ability to adapt and transform.
                                Detroit's current renaissance proves this.
