                            <h4>Understanding Local Weather Threats:</h4>
                            
                            <p><strong>Spring (March-May):</strong> Severe thunderstorms increase with warming temps. Hail and high winds common. Rapid temperature fluctuations stress roofing materials recovering from winter.</p>

                            <p><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Peak severe weather season. Afternoon/evening thunderstorms can produce baseball-sized hail, 60-80 mph straight-line winds, occasional tornadoes. Highest risk period for Sterling Heights roof damage.</p>

                            <p><strong>Fall (September-November):</strong> Continued storm activity though less frequent. Early season snowfall can catch homeowners off-guard. Tree branches weakened by summer storms fail during autumn winds.</p>

                            <p><strong>Winter (December-February):</strong> Ice storms coating everything in ice, heavy snow loads, and extreme cold. While fewer traditional "storms," winter weather causes different damage types requiring insurance claims.</p>

                                <p>When damage is discovered during tear-off (hidden decking damage, etc.), we file supplements to get additional coverage. Many contractors skip this step leaving homeowners paying out-of-pocket.</p>

                                <h4>Q: How long do I have to file a storm damage claim?</h4>
                                <p>A: Most policies require claims within 1-2 years of damage. However, file as soon as possible after storms for best results. Delays make it harder to prove damage was storm-related vs. normal wear.</p>

                            <div class="faq-item glass-card">
                                <h4>Q: Will filing a claim raise my insurance rates?</h4>
                                <p>A: Storm damage claims (wind, hail, trees) typically don't raise rates significantly as they're "acts of God" beyond your control. However, multiple claims over short periods may affect future insurability. This is still better than paying $10,000+ out-of-pocket for repairs.</p>

                                <h4>Q: What if insurance company denies my claim?</h4>
                                <p>A: We help appeal denials with additional documentation and expert assessments. Many initial denials are overturned on appeal. As a last resort, public adjusters or attorneys may be necessary for complex disputes.</p>
