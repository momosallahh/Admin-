                                <h4>Q: How long will my residential roof replacement take?</h4>
                                <p>A: Most Sterling Heights homes are completed in 2-4 days. Typical ranch homes take 2-3 days, bi-levels 2-4 days, colonials 3-5 days. Weather can extend timelines, but we work efficiently to minimize disruption to your family's routine.</p>

                                <h4>Q: Will I need to leave during the roof replacement?</h4>
                                <p>A: No. Most Sterling Heights families stay home during installation. Noise will be significant during tear-off (usually one day), so some families prefer to be out that day. Otherwise, normal activities can continue inside.</p>

                                <h4>Q: What roofing materials do you recommend for Sterling Heights homes?</h4>
                                <p>A: Architectural shingles (GAF Timberline HDZ, CertainTeed Landmark) offer best value for most homes - excellent durability in our climate, 25-30 year lifespan, and attractive appearance. Premium options available for higher-end homes. Metal roofing excellent for longevity if budget allows.</p>
