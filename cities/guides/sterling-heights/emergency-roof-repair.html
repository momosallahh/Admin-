                        <p>When disaster strikes your Sterling Heights roof, every minute counts.

                        <p>Elite Roofing Michigan provides 24/7 emergency roof repair services throughout Sterling Heights with same-day response (typically 2-4 hours). Our experienced emergency crews understand the urgency when your family's safety and home are at risk.

                            <h4>Proactive Steps Sterling Heights Homeowners Should Take:</h4>
                            
                            <ul class="prevention-list">
                                <li><strong>Annual Inspections:</strong> Schedule professional inspection each fall before winter. Identifies problems while they're still minor and addressable during good weather.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Tree Maintenance:</strong> Trim branches within 10 feet of roof. Especially critical near Dodge Park and Clinton River Trail where mature trees pose risks during storms.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Gutter Cleaning:</strong> Clean gutters twice yearly (spring/fall). Clogged gutters cause ice dams and water backup under shingles - common Sterling Heights problem.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Ventilation Upgrades:</strong> Ensure proper attic ventilation to prevent ice dams. If you experience ice dams, upgrade ventilation before next winter - emergency ice dam removal is expensive.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Address Minor Issues:</strong> Don't ignore small leaks or missing shingles. A $400 repair today prevents $4,000 emergency tomorrow when storm hits.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Know Your Roof Age:</strong> If roof approaching 20+ years, plan replacement before emergency failure. Proactive replacement costs less than emergency work plus interior damage.</li>
                                
                                <li><strong>Insurance Review:</strong> Ensure adequate coverage including emergency services, replacement cost (not actual cash value), and reasonable deductibles.</li>

                                <p>A: No. We use proper techniques that secure tarps without creating additional damage. Tarps are weighted and fastened to prevent wind uplift while avoiding unnecessary penetrations. Our crews are trained in emergency procedures that protect your property.</p>

                                <p>A: Most homeowners policies cover emergency services for covered perils (storm damage, fallen trees, sudden damage). We provide documentation meeting insurance requirements and can often bill insurance directly. Review your specific policy for coverage details.</p>
